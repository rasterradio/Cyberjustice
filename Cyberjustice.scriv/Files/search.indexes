            <Text>WHERE THE LORE?

Bond makes his job look easy. Zima also does, but in reality the player is struggling to win fights, Zima gets beat up, isn’t “perfect” like Bond. Has to accept that this problem is bigger than one person to accomplish. At first she rejects help but has to accept it and admit that she puts on a cool cover to intimidate the enemy and to inspire those around her. Putting your life on the line is scary but you do it, and ultimately that’s what makes her “cool” (in the eyes of a rookie?)

------------------

why does the illuminati feel that an anarcho-capitalist world pushes human evolution? as opposed to a monarchy.

illuminati, king, these are people who think they know what's best for the world. Should humanity choose for itself, or do we need these leaders to choose what's best for us?

rebellion needs a better name

we need a person (or chorus of persons) to represent the illuminati--think helios in DX

bounce Zima off more on recurring characters (Prince, King, Justs (pick some of these and put them in early, even things like King or a Marshal mentioning one of the other Justs and having Zima respond))

rebellion leader character

foreman was just a guarddog, unaware of the actual picture

Lore bit: Illuminati is responsible for other elements in the past like King's Dad taking the throne, because it was the right step for the time, Illuminati also responsible for augs/Zima?

SWERYISM: Three mysteries--mystery of plot, mystery of protagonist, and mystery of developing relationship between characters (here it would be Zima/King/Prince/one of the Justs)

CHARACTERS
Zima - Aries, Capricorn
Prince - Gemini
King - Cancer
Illuminati leader (chorus) - Libra
Illuminati proxy (woman) - Pisces
Just(s)
Army leader - Pisces
each need bios and relationships to each other. And try to fit each in ASAP and in as many places as possible (e.g. if Zima storms a winter base have another Just join her and both of them escape the base with the Prince while confronting the army leader)

Prince: he's gotta be immediately likeable. Everything his father isn't: cool, talkative, flirty, someone who likes to push Zima's buttons. But also professional, let him make mistakes and learn from them, but he should be every bit Zima's equal both in combat and character. Maybe we can take away one of Zima's combat abilities and give it to him (or invent a new one). Thing is he can’t be cool and collected because Zima is. So he needs to be smart, but not street smart. He’s been secluded and doesn’t know enough about the world, but he knows things about politics and such that Zima doesn’t. But he’s eager to learn more, in a cute sort of way. He trusts Zima and looks to learn from her about combat and the life of commoners, but maybe he’s more sympathetic to them than she is. Maybe even he gains skills/gets stronger in combat throughout the game (Zima stays static but gets better items/augs).


CH 3: Commercial capital is gross capitalism, Zima has to do sleuthing to find the Woman with the ring, turns out the Illuminati isn't that big a secret (King knows about them and Woman assumes he told Zima (&quot;oh, he didn't tell you? poor thing. Maybe you're not his favourite anymore. He's powerless you know&quot; yadda yadda)
-Zima arrives at the capital, has a lead on the bomb/ring woman Foreman mentioned (they found something in the rubble of the lab perhaps). 
-Has to go around the area, talk to people and such, find info, during this time learns why this world needs heavier governing (gross capitalism)
-Meets up with the Just group, some of them split up to find their own clues
-When Zima finds evidence you return to the HQ to talk it over with Justs since they know the area better. Finding each clue leads to a new spot.
-Going on patrol in this chapter can have you bump into another Just
-Zima finds location of Illuminati HQ (you can optionally bring the other Justs with you, they’re locked off separately
-Illuminati members coerce Zima to join, she refuses and fights them
-Zima fights her way out, joined by the Justs
-Heads off to find Prince. 

CH4: -Zima goes to a small town near the base where the Prince is being kept [what is special about the town?]
-Villagers aren’t happy about the big military base offer to help Zima. There are military patrols out for her and there is light stealth similar to Black Market.
-Can try to storm the base at any time but they’re way too strong, either there’s a back entrance or for every sidequest you do, you have more help to get inside (each person that joins helps you like giving you supplies, smokescreening the enemies, etc)
-Rescue Prince who tells Zima the plan
-Defeats army captain [revealed to be a Just? Or bitter that they weren’t chosen to be one], Prince helps in fight
-Prince gets Zima to drop him off with the Rebellion, gives Zima tips on talking to his Dad but knows the chat won’t go well.
-Zima calls King demanding an explanation, he accuses her of siding with the Prince and planning to overthrow the Kingdom. Declares her a traitor [Why does King want Zima to investigate Prince’s “death” but not find him? He wasn’t planning for the Illuminati to interfere, so Zima would find the “evidence” necessary to declare war?] Then he sends the other Just to kill Zima and Prince.

CH5: -Prince thinks his Dad can be reasoned with, Zima is ready to fight, they fight about this and Zima concedes that she’ll try to think of something along the way. Not that she wants to kill him.
-Zima reenters the Kingdom, makes her way to the Palace, along the way dealing with each member of the Just (boss rush), each with their own combat styles. They’ll join her if you’ve been arresting people, otherwise they’ll call you mad.
-Zima meets the King (any joined Justs wait outside in case things get ugly, Zima wants to talk with him one on one). He’s cooled down now and explains his situation: that the Illuminati is trying to get the people to overthrow him and he can only stop them with the “death” of the Prince, he can rule for years to come and try to provide the best for his people instead of handing things off to someone else.
-Zima tries to talk him out of it but he won’t budge. He’s even prepared to let Zima and the Prince go(?) But Zima knows she has to fight him.
-1v1 big battle! If Zima arrests him she has to say something about taking him in because he broke his own laws. [we need reasoning for him to actually get arrested, like, Zima has hard evidence of his meddling (Zima records it because she expects to die, or the other Justs hear everything).]
- Zima gets a call from the Prince telling her the resistance is under attack by an army (it’s the Illuminati because they know the King is out of commission [that would mean they’re bugging the throne room or something? Maybe this doesn’t have to be explained. They are the illuminati after all.] they want to kill the Prince to end the monarchy (now that the Prince is presumed dead they can easily step in and assume control of the Kingdom)

CH6: -King is dying/arrested when Prince calls. He hates Zima and Prince but he’d rather the Prince take the throne than the Illuminati, so he tells Zima where he suspects they’ve taken him. (where, exactly?)
-Zima has to keep the King’s death a secret to avoid Illuminati attack/Getting the arrested King to declare war is a last-ditch resort, so Zima infiltrates the compound and rescues the Prince who expresses sadness over his father but also a strong desire to lead the nation. 
-Zima and Prince are left to make a stand against the Illuminati’s forces. If Zima didn’t kill the Just they show up to the rescue [if there was a reason for them not to be in one place it’s pointless now because King is dead?] and they destroy the computer controlling the AI. The Prince takes the throne, frees Zima of her charges. The Illuminati go back into hiding.
-If the Just don’t arrive then Zima and the Prince don’t survive the fight, Illuminati take over the kingdom and we go full cyberpunk. Ouch!
—————


&quot;I don't care if you're the Illuminati or Mickey Mouse (MIZA?). I'm kicking your ass.&quot;
Oh yeah don’t forget MIZA is in the game and can talk sometimes

G. Foreman return: “Y’know Kid, all this time I’ve been hoping you’d make it this far. Last fight was just too much fun! The only sad part was, we weren’t playing fair. You’ve got all those fancy augmentations, and now, so do I.”

Vagrant Story parallels: Zima = Ashley
Prince = Merlose, Sydney
King = Guildenstern, Duke
Maybe the intro is someone uncovering Zima’s story
Needs a human element: Ashley’s mysterious past, Sydney sees right through him
All the problems in VS created by Duke protecting his son
Needs confrontations between Prince and King
Needs a clearer villain (same way Sydney sees through Ashley, twist of course being that they aren’t the true villain)

Research illuminati, fall of russian monarchy, maoism, political anime like gundam, more matsuno 

*Ashley is a calm and just soldier. A loyal agent with a strong sense of duty, he is a prized agent among the VKP. As he dislikes working with others, he initially comes off as taciturn and unfriendly. He is later revealed to be a caring type, showing concern for fellow soldiers and empathy for some of his enemies. He is emotionally fragile, shown by his reactions when betrayed or manipulated. According to Sydney, Ashley's defining trait is child-like faith.*

But why is Zima like this? In Ashley’s case he was brainwashed. In Zima’s case, bred by the King but there has to be more.

What if Zima is chasing a villain who lusts to take the throne, and King kills them? Like how Sydney kills Rosencrantz. Need to show King as more morally ambiguous. King does it himself because he doesn’t want anyone else to know about it? Including Zima? Maybe this is where he plans to kill Zima and “deal” with the Prince.

Maybe Zima has PTSD, loss of her partner? Explains why she feels protective of others, like Prince
Okay but what if Prince had a Prince reference like a spell called “shockadelica”

——————

we have been driven into neofeudalism. What happened to feudalism the last time - the American and French revolutons. We've just exchanged kings for bankers. Churches for media.

Overthrow a monarchy, switch to democracy, and see how long it takes for power to consolidate in the few. People desire to be lead. It's why we believe in omnipotent gods. Why trust in a group of flawed individuals that reach consensus through fights on podiums when you can trust in a single king, flawed as he may be?

- three different storylines intersecting: who killed the prince, a mystery about the protagonist and a relationship between the Zima and the Prince (and King)

—————

Justs are female because augs adapt slightly better to female brains, and differences in size and strength averages is of no concern when augments do most of the work. This is also why large muscles aren't required for Justs.

&quot;Those are some nice augs. But if I smash that brain of yours, you'll be just another mannequin&quot;

Being a Just means using whatever tools are on hand, hence buying goods. Money is traceless unlike government issued weapons (still don’t buy this)

Basically write her as Nicholas Angel from Hot Fuzz (characters she speaks with will need to be lighter-hearted to offer a dynamic)

Zima: &quot;Who's the target?&quot;
Commander: &quot;Leader of a small revolutionary group. They're calling for open trade borders between nations. Getting violent at guardposts. Couple of murders.&quot;

[It's like FFVII: Fire escape is tedious but safer, elevator is riskier but faster. Player can set which floor they want to arrive on?]
Another agent here that Zima doesn't know about?


The guards already know to expect Zima. This worries her because she was supposed to have the element of surprise. Later she hears something about two intruders in the building. Then finds the dead bodies and afterward Vesna. At some point you get to talk to one of the foreign soldiers? Or at least eavesdrop on a conversation. You can talk to Vesna briefly before she leaves and Zima gets a small exploration segment before defeating the leader who Vesna kills (think the Russians in Resident Evil 3). Seeing the power of another Just could be done similarly to Roche in FF7R, so she wants to know Zima's rank and test her power. Maybe they duel in Chapter 3.


&quot;Thanks to you I've been on a goose chase all over this damn kingdom.&quot;
Vesna trying to piss Zima off, make her lose her cool. Zima gives in and they fight, Vesna wants to test her strength because she desires Zima's position, Zima giving into her anger (briefly). Before realizing that it's the wrong place to put it.


King will mention Zima's failure but forgive her, Prince won't mind. Here they will talk about what was foreshadowed by the rebel leader.


Locations:
Hospital
(Promenade with park and fountain down below)
Apartments
Mall
Look into light gun games, how they progress and evolve environments
Something with interesting backgrounds for Bressan, hopefully unique from the rest of the game and memorable
All the better if it can offer unique gameplay/exploration/dialogue and worldbuilding
Die Hard plaza setting?
Train (moving inside/outside, through cars, themed differently, residential vs cargo, engine cabin)
Airport (starport I guess)


So far we got:
-Palace
-City Streets
-Casino
-Battle Arena
-Military Base
-Outer Space
-Nightclub


It's going to be a penthouse



Penthouse is owned by a diplomat of the foreign kingdom, or a rich immigrant. Terrorists are forcibly taking him back.
His penthouse is decorated with stuff that characterizes this other nation
Zima is supposed to rescue him. Does Vesna kill the terrorist leader, or the captive? Either one could know about the plan. It probably makes more sense for Vesna to kill the leader.


Only thing is, Zima also barely follows the rules. She’s supposed to be the loose cannon, and Vesna is supposed to be one of the voices of reason against Zima when she’s risking lives on a hunch, and then going off on her own in Chapter 4. 


Let’s assume Vesna blows Zima’s cover, shows you the extent of the Just’s power, you get to talk to her in the intro, you duel in chapter 3


Have something where Zima is attacked and should lose her life but is saved by augs (to show that she’s more than human). Then you get into a fight and get to play as her


So you explore, break into the penthouse and look around, your cover is blown and Zima gets shot or something but she’s ok due to augs, you get into a fight, explore and talk, another fight then you go to the roof and there’s a boss fight, Vesna demonstes her power and blows up the leader or captive, end intro.


Need to guide Ithiro on how to connect rooms


Should it be a penthouse? Since after this you’re in Zima’s apartment
Maybe it should be somewhere else just for visual variety


Opera House
Ballroom
Bank


But why would some diplomat be at these places? Kinda puts bank out of the question. The others, you assume guests that could be dead or in the process of being rescued. 


Opera House--idk how you can design that vertically at the top of a building and have an interesting location.


Ballroom--part of a larger building. Could work.

Maybe ballroom isn’t the right word but rather a party scene? That could be in a fancy penthouse apartment.


Maybe, penthouse is okay as long as you aren’t wasting time in bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, the places you also spend in Zima’s apartment. And Bressan can focus the background visuals on other things.


So you emerge onto the roof. There’s a skylight but it’s too dangerous? Or maybe that’s an alternate way in that has you fighting more people? Idk maybe we shouldn’t even offer that if it doesn’t make narrative sense.


Let’s assume you take a fire escape. You sneak into some upper hallways with bedrooms and because you don’t have the element of surprise, Zima gets shot or stabbed but is ok, and you get a tutorial battle. Then you move into the penthouse itself, get a chance to talk to Vesna, she runs off, you get into another fight, you find the hostage, run to the roof and fight the boss, Vesna blows up and you escape.


Maybe there’s a SWAT4 mission approp for this? Like the fancy office level.


“just make a cool outside staircase that leads from the balcony to the helipad
it's a penthouse it has all sorts of cool shit”


“ou could do it like the action movies
like make her climb from outside
or just dropping with perfect precision from a helicopter
remember you got cyberpunk tech to make it work
maybe she could just walk in, simply hacking all the cameras on her way”


“but the more modern cameras can't, and that's for when we want to make them relevant for a scene
maybe a disguide could work?
she already disguises herself in a later scene
in the black market”


“we could make it into a thing she can do well, disguises”


Re: Zima’s powers being unveiled in the intro:
“and the excuse is that she's keeping up her disguise”



Keep in mind what areas are in the palace (immediately after Zima’s place) to avoid repetition


Zima’s:
Kitchen
Bathroom
Bedroom
Living Room


Palace:
Throne room

ASK WHY SHE’S HERE (mention capitol, outer rim, chapter 3 location)
ASK ABOUT THE BODIES
ASK ABOUT THE AMBASSADOR
ASK ABOUT HER SWORD (talk about augs, kingdom)

Ask why she’s here:
Zima: “What are you doing here? The palace assigned me to this mission.”

Vesna: “A patrol officer at the Commercial Capitol border mentioned the Roschian’s plans, and I wanted in on the fun. It’s not fair to have the action all to yourself, Zima.”

Ask her about the bodies:
Zima: “So these bodies are your handiwork?”

Vesna: “Only the terrorists. Couldn’t do a thing about the dinner guests.”

Vesna: “You know how these hostage situations go: they tell you to stop, you pull out the intestines of his friends, and pretty soon there’s no more hostages to worry about.”

Ask about her sword:
Zima: (She eyes me and cleans the blood off her sword. She flicks a drop into the air and catches it with her tongue.)

Vesna: “Heh, you like it?”

Vesna: “I suppose you haven’t seen me since academy training. I never leave home without this puppy.”

Zima: “Can never be too careful these days. Commercial Capitol’s a dangerous place.”

Vesna: “And clearly you keep the Royal City in check.”

Zima: “Yes, your blowing my cover only makes my job easier.”

Zima: (Vesna winks.)

Ask about the Ambassador:
Zima: “And our damsel in distress is past this door?”

Vesna: “Only place left I haven’t cut through.”

Vesna: “You ready?” y/n

No:
Vesna: “Then don’t wander too far.” [[break dialog, return to room]]

Yes:
Zima: “Let’s make this quick and keep him alive.”

Zima: (She looks towards me.)

Vesna: “I’ll leave that part to you.”

Zima: “On the count of one… two… three…—”

Skorpion: “HOSTILE PRESENCES DETECTED”

Zima: “Great, of course you had to have a security mech.”

Zima: (Vesna is on the ground, unconscious. Her leg looks broken. The ambassador is hiding by Vesna.)

Skorpion: “PREPARE TO SUBMIT TO THE GLORY OF THE KINGDOM”

Ambassador: “Protect me, Just! And do a better job than this one did.”

Zima: “With pleasure.”

[boss fight! I’ll write some broken English battle lines for the boss]

Zima: “Hey Ambassador, are you alive?”

Ambassador: “Yes, I suppose so…”

Zima: “Then I’ll call this one in. HQ, take us home.”

Officer: “**Understood, Just.**”

Zima: “Vesna?”

Vesna: “Mh.”

Zima: “Good.”

Leader: “Lbh guvax guvf vf gur raq bs nalguvat...”

Leader: “*cough, cough*”

Zima: “Ah, our last remaining friend. Before I go, you’ll be telling me everything about all of your friends.”

Leader: “Fbba lbh'yy xabj nyy gbb jryy gur vaivfvoyr unaq...”

Leader: “Good Samaritan—”

*BLAM*

Zima: “Vesna, what the hell! He’s dead!”

Vesna: “Bastard ruined my leg…”

Officer: “Just Zima, the cleanup crew is touching down. We’ll take things from here.”

Zima: “…Good, because I need an aspirin.”

if it's the first visit:
AI: &quot;Welcome to the Royal Palace. Please state your business.&quot;

Zima: &quot;It's Zima the Just. I'm meeting with the King.&quot;

AI: &quot;Welcome back, Zima. Please proceed to the throne room.&quot;
}

(Throne Room)

CHECK THE ROOM
WATCH THE MEETING
TALK WITH THE KING
GO TO THE TROPHY ROOM
GO TO THE KING'S CHAMBERS
RETURN TO THE MAP

Check the room:
(if scene = 2):
&quot;A monitor broadcasts the treaty signing, with groups of people in suits shaking hands. The King is by the window, in his thoughts.&quot;

else:
&quot;A monitor broadcasts the treaty signing, with people taking turns on a podium in an assembly hall. The King’s throne sits empty.&quot;

Watch the meeting:
&quot;Greetings for the signing are almost done and representatives of the Confederacy are waiting outside a negotiation room. We’ll bring you updates as they’re available&quot;

Talk with the king:
If he's not there:
Zima: (He's not in the throne room. Must be somewhere on this floor.)

If he's there:
King: &quot;Zima. It's been a while, girl. Maybe too long.&quot;

Zima: &quot;Your Grace, as always I am pleased to see you in good health and-&quot;

King: &quot;Oh, cut that out. You know I hate it when you do that.&quot;

Zima: (He cracks a smile.)

Zima: &quot;Always, Sir. I understand you wanted me here for a special reason?&quot;

King: “Today’s trade deal could bring peace with the bordering state of the Confederacy. But our relationship has long been thin and this treaty comes out of the blue. The meeting may be a trap.”

King: “ I fear the treaty will bring dire consequences for my rule, and for my heir.&quot;

Zima: “And I take it your council won’t let you leave the negotiations.”

King: “We’re on the verge of losing our place in our former Capital. They’re right in not wanting to sacrifice this signing.”

Zima: “Who’s guarding the Prince during the meeting?”

King: “I didn’t send you because a Just by a table wouldn’t be a good look. No offence.”

Zima: (I cast a mocking eyebrow at him.)

King: “Whatever they’re planning, I don’t think harming the Prince is a priority. Still, I’m telling you this because there are rumors the Confederacy might be behind these violent splinter groups.”

Zima: “That would be an efficient way to hurt you, but those have been going on for years.”

King: “I’m still trying to figure that one out myself. So once the signing is over, I want you to be in the Colony to investigate the emissaries and their activities. See if they’re up to anything.”

Zima: “I understand, your Grace.”

King: “Forgive the secrecy, and I know my premonitions haven’t always been true, but I can’t ignore this feeling. Good luck.”

New Objective: Tail the Confederate emissaries
}

ASK ABOUT THE CONFEDERACY
ASK ABOUT THE PRINCE
ASK ABOUT THE KINGDOM
SAY GOODBYE

Ask about the confederacy:
Zima: “Your Grace, what are your thoughts on the Confederacy?”

King: “My father was right to never trust merchants and autocrats. They have slowed our expansion enough and if this treaty won’t get them off our backs, I’ll have to come up with something else.”
}

Ask about the Prince:
Zima: “What if the Prince gets hurt, your Grace?”

King: “They wouldn’t dare, girl. They know it would mean a swift end for some tiny merchants to declare war on a kingdom.”
}

Ask about the Kingdom:
Zima: “What does the Kingdom think of the treaty?”

King: “The Prince handles most public relations, and the people see him as looking to repair bonds. There’s also optimism for the economy.”

Say goodbye:
Zima: “Then I’ll take my leave.”
[[end convo]]

* * * * 
Go to the trophy room:
CHECK THE ROOM
CHECK THE KING’S HEIRLOOMS
CHECK THE JUKEBOX
RETURN TO THE THRONE ROOM

Check the room:
Zima: (Books and paintings stretch up to the fading skylight. The King’s father built this room to commemorate the creation of this free state.)

Check the King’s heirlooms:
Zima: (In the center of the room there are a collection of glass display cases. They include a stone ring, a gun from the pre-Structure era and a photograph of the King’s father.)
Check the jukebox:
If Zima has copied the song:
Zima: (The jukebox lets out a steady hum of pre-Structure music.)

If Zima hasn’t copied the song:
Zima: (The jukebox lets out a steady hum of pre-Structure music. Should I send a copy of the song to my music player at home?)

If yes:
Miza: “Wahooo! Song sent!”
}

Go to the King's chambers:
If the King is in the throne room:
King: “Zima, what are you doing?”

Zima: “Er, I’m making sure the room is secure in an emergency.”

else:
Zima: (The door is shut. Should I go in?)

CHECK THE DOOR
OPEN DOOR
RETURN TO THE THRONE ROOM

Check the door (after listening or if the player walks away from the door and comes back):
Zima: (The door is shut tight. I don’t hear any voices on the other side anymore.)

Check the door (first visit):
Zima: (The door is shut tight. I think I can hear the King’s voice behind the door. Should I listen in?)

If yes:
King: “-unfit for it. I'm afraid it's a necessary loss. For the greater good, I suppose.&quot;

Male voice: “I'm afraid so. There will be a price, but we will rout them out.&quot;

Zima: (There’s a pause.)

King: &quot;For what you're asking me for… it had better.&quot;

Zima: (There’s no sound. I had better keep this to myself for now.)

[[From here, if the player goes to the trophy room or returns to the palace, the King will be back in the throne room.]]




Open door:
Zima: (The door is locked.)


Return to the throne room:

Zima: *My neural augs give me a bit of adrenaline. I need it.*

AI: “Good morning Zima. The temperature outside is 75F, and rainstorms are expected to start later in the day.”

AI: “Do you wish to calibrate your augmentations?”

If yes:
AI: “Understood, checking your augmentations and programming today’s schedule.&quot;

AI: “UPDATING SCHEDULE, FINE TUNING COMBAT AUGS, ESTABLISHING CONTACT WITH INTERNAL NEURAL PROCESSORS, LOGGING IN WITH YOUR KING'S ACCOUNTS FOR SERVICES...”

AI: “Finished. Enjoy your day Zima. I've set your mission briefing system. If you're unsure of what to do next, check the upper-left corner of your GUI.”

If no:
	AI: “The lack of check-ups can lead to trouble in your daily transactions and activities as a Just, Zima.”
}

Zima: *Today I have to report to HQ on last night’s operation, get updated on any cases, and meet with the King.*

Check the room:
Zima: *The bedroom. I’ve got some old books on a shelf, and in the closet I keep my uniforms and enforcement gear.*

Look outside:
Zima: *Great pillars of polished concrete stretch up beneath and past me. On top of the next set of parallel buildings are stretches of astroturf with people relaxing under umbrellas. Down on the ground there’s a mess of a bright cityscape. I’ve got a great view from up here.*

Living Room: 

Zima: *The living room. There’s some magazines I’ve yet to get through, a sound system, and the TV.*

Change clothes:
King’s sanctioned outfit
Casual work attire
Nightgown
Don’t change clothes

King’s sanctioned:
AI: “The clothes will be left, ready to wear, in the bedroom after your shower.”

Casual work attire:
Zima: *Although it’s a sanctioned outfit, it might not be appropriate to wear for my meeting with the King. Should I really go to headquarters wearing this?*

Yes:
AI: “The clothes will be left, ready to wear, in the bathroom after you shower. Against my better judgement.”

No:
Zima: *Should I ask for the Just outfit instead?*

Yes: 
AI: “I’ll leave your official Just attire ready for you in the bedroom after you shower.”


Nightgown:
AI: “I highly recommend you change, Zima. It wouldn’t be appropriate to wear to your royal meeting.”

Agree:
Zima: “You’re right. I’ll pick something else.”

Disagree:
Zima: “Oh lighten up, computer.”

AI: “I can’t commend your decision, Zima. I’ll leave a proper change of clothes in the bedroom should you change your mind.”

Turn on the TV

Zima: *I don’t have a channel plan, but I do get government-sanctioned stations. Right now it’s just political debates.*

Check the magazines

Zima: *The magazines refresh to the newest issues. One subscription header reads ‘PRINCE TO DEAL WITH CONFEDERACY TODAY’. Oh! And there’s a new issue of Bullet’s Digest.*

Kitchen:

Zima: *The kitchen. I’m not much of a cook, so ingredients are relegated to dehydrated goods.”

If Zima hasn’t eaten:
Zima: “AI, I’ll have something hearty.”

AI: “I’ll do processed insect meat buns. A protein-rich meal that is easy on the ecosystem. Coming right up.”

AI: “And I’ll put some vitamin syrup on the side, just the way you like it.”

Zima: “I’ll eat in the living room.”

If Zima has eaten:
Zima: “Nah, I’m full.”

Eating in the living room:

Watch the show:
Interviewer: “And we’re back with Paul Corduroy, a professor of political science at The University. Professor Corduroy, what’s your take on the debate over the King’s health?”

Corduroy: “I think it’s less of a question of whether the King is fit to lead, and more of, ‘how much longer will he be able to lead?’”

Corduroy: “We’ve all been subject to the destabilized economy, and the tax hikes that do nothing. And we’ve seen the King’s ageing appearance--ever since his surgery.”

Corduroy: “These are classic symptoms of a leader unable to keep up with the demands of their position. In fact, if I were the Prince--” PWIP

Zima: “Hah, you wish you were royalty.”

Eat the meat bun:
Zima: *Crunchy. I can’t decide if that’s a good thing.*

Drink the vitamin syrup:
Zima: *Urk--it’s like a mix of metal and citrics. But I always feel great after I drink it.*

Put away the drink:
Zima: *On second thought, maybe I won’t have any.*

Bathroom:

Check the room and there’s a medspray:
Zima: *It’s clean and spacious. There’s a medspray under the sink. Should I take it?*

Check the room without medspray:
Zima: *It’s clean and spacious.*

Take a shower:
Zima: “Brrr! Nothing like a cold shower to wake you up.”

Change clothes:
If wearing casual clothes:
Zima: *I’m probably not dressed ideally for today’s work. Should I change into my official attire?*

If wearing official clothes:
Zima: *What I’m wearing should be suitable for today’s work. Should I change into my casual clothes?*

If wearing nightgown:
Zima: *My official attire is hanging by the door. Should I put it on?*
}

Look in the mirror:
Zima: *Augs sit under my skin and give me a thin-blooded appearance. It’s a little intimidating. There’s a strand of white hair poking out under my bangs. I zap it to its proper color.*

Recharging station:
Zima: *A recharging station. I press the palm of my hand against it and feel a cool surge of electrical power. Augs feel in top shape.*

Medspray lines:
Pick up Medspray:
Zima: *I’ll take this.*

Don’t take Medspray:
Zima: *I’ll leave it for later.*

Go outside:
If wearing proper clothes:
AI: “Have a nice day, Zima.”

If wearing indoor clothes:
AI: “Zima, may I remind you that your safety chip for operating King sanctioned vehicles is stitched in your outdoor clothes. I’ve left an appropriate pair of clothing on your bed.”

            <Text>Zima: “The Kingdom. The last stand of structure in his rotting world. Free from the power of the corporations that swallowed governments and monarchies. The only thing keeping us free is the King…”

Zima: “...and the King's hands, the Just.”

“SYSTEM TURN ON”

&quot;Hello Just agent 0042. Welcome to the setup matrix. To serve is divine.&quot;

Zima: &quot;To serve is divine.&quot;

Robot: &quot;To further enhance your proficiency in combat, I will assist you with statistical information pertaining to combat performance.&quot;

Zima: &quot;Then let's do a test run.&quot;

[SICK ASS ANIME INTRO CREDIT SEQUENCE (OR NOT), IT IS APRIL 29TH 2085 OR WHATEVER YEAR YOU WANT IT TO BE]

Zima: &quot;Rebels. I can smell them a mile away.&quot;

Zima: “Lights are off. I’m going in silent.”

You touch down on the rain-slick tarmac. You take {LIST INVENTORY} from the back of your ship. Ahead is a pair of thugs.

Thug 1: “Help me with my light.”

Thug 2: “Sure.”

Thug 2: “How long do you think we have till the blues show up?”

Thug 1: “Don’t need long. Apparently we’re just here to make a statement.”

Thug 2: “Hmph.”

One of the rebels walks away. You sit for a moment to make sure the two of you won’t be heard--

Miza: “Hiiiii agent~ I’m MIZA! Your new police force mascot! I’m here to tell you all about your cool new combat module!”

Zima: “Oh no…”

Miza: “I've detected that you're just about to engage in combat. Once you do, I'll project myself onto the field to help you better understand your new battle interface!”

Zima: &quot;AI, who greenlit this?&quot;

Thug: “Hey, who's there?”

Zima: &quot;Looks like I've got no time to setup.&quot;

BATTLE ONE
Raster: [[should we give players the chance to skip the tutorial?]]

Welcome to the advanced combat tutorial Agent 0042.

Zima: &quot;Hey, how do I turn this off?”

Your new combat augmentation provides a retinal link to a combat drone, allowing for a bird's-eye view of battle.

On the bottom-right of your HUD is an estimate of your health alongside how much ammo is in your weapon.

All units in battle have their Health represented by the green bar below them.

The white vertical bar is the Turn bar. You can choose what action to perform next once yours is filled.

*wait for the turn bar to fill
In order to use Gun-based attacks, you must first Take Aim. You can only fire your gun after you execute the Take Aim action and enter an Aiming state.

*player is forced to choose the Take Aim action

After you choose what action to perform, the Action bar will appear, and when it is filled the action will execute.

Different actions can be slower or faster to execute, as stated in the description bar. Be mindful of the timing of your actions.

*turn bar fills again

You can choose to change what action you'll perform before it's executed if the Turn Bar fills again before the Action one does. Doing so will reset the Action bar to zero.

For now just choose to continue performing the action. This will reset the Turn Bar to half instead of zero.

You can either press the Continue Action button, located where the current action's button was, or press the ESC or Right Mouse Button, to do so.

*force the player to continue performing the action and wait for it be executed

You're now Aiming and can shoot with your gun. However, you'll lose your Aim if you're hit with disabling attacks or perform physically intensive actions.

Check the description bar as you hover over buttons to see what actions maintain your Aim when you perform them.

Other things to consider are that you can be Disarmed, requiring you to perform an action to pick it back up, and that you must Reload if you run out of bullets, if you have ammo to do so.

Now, shoot the enemy. You can shoot him in different parts of the body for various effects as shown in the description bar.

*force the player to perform the Fire Gun action and wait for its completion.

Some actions can miss, as shown when you're selecting the target. A dice briefly appears once the action is executed showing the percentage rolled.

The battle is over once all hostiles are either dead or Arrested. Successfully performing the Arrest action on an enemy will immobilize them, but executing the action can be difficult. However, enemies near death may Surrender, and Arresting them will always work.

Now, try to neutralize the suspect in front of you by killing or Arresting him.

*End battle

You look above. A pulsing yellow light from the top of the structure signals the control deck. 

Zima: “I don’t have much time.”

You move onwards. Around a series of metal beams--up a flight of stairs.

Thug: “It’s a cop!”

You’re faced with a group of rebels firing across the platform. You draw your pistol.

BATTLE TWO
Progressing to the tutorial section 2 of 3.

Zima: [I found the 'ultra-succinct mode' key.]  [[I’m using square braces to denote thought when a section is already in italics.]]

There are several Stances combatants can take.

Stances change your chance to hit and evade Melee and Gun attacks, and may limit what actions you can perform.

For example, you might want to use Melee Attacks instead of your gun to deal damage, as despite being slower and weaker in general, they don't need you to Take Aim first, don't require bullets and you can't de Disarmed of Melee Weapons.

However you can't perform Melee Attacks while Knocked Down or Behind Cover, so you must Stand up or at least Crouch up in order to do so.

There are several Actions you can take to change you and your enemies' stances.

One of the most complex actions that affect Stances is the Grapple. Successfully Grappling an enemy puts you in the Grappling Stance, lowering your overall chance to evade attacks and severely limiting what actions you can take. However, the target enemy is put into the Grappled Stance, receiving even greater penalties to his evasion and available actions.

Attacks on a Grappling or Grappled combatant have a 50% chance to target the other one instead.

Now, use your knowledge of Stances and Melee Attacks to dispatch of the two attackers ahead.
*End battle

Miza: “You found an item! Good scavenging skills agent! Press ESC or the Right Mouse Button to open the main menu. From there you can use consumable items or equip them for use in battle. You can also equip different weapons and augmentation parts to boost your combat abilities.”

The yellow light blares brighter as you approach the pump room. You make an attempt to slide the rain off your coat and out of your hair.

You enter the pump room. A tall man in coat and gloves is hammering on a computer terminal.

Zima: “I wouldn’t try that if I were you.”

The leader turns from the control panel.

Leader: “Planning to arrest me?”

You draw your pistol. “That depends on what happens next.”

Leader: “I could send this place packing. The resulting oil spill would soil the drinking water of a hundred nearby homes.”

Zima: “But you won’t. Resistance mercs fight ‘for the people’. You would think we could work together.”

Leader: “You’re one of the King’s hands, right? You’re not here to protect the people. You’re here to protect your government.”

Leader: “What would you know about being a citizen.”

He moves his hand near his coat. In a flash you put a hole through the fabric of his jacket.

At the sound of the shot, two rebels enter from the door on his side.

BOSS BATTLE
Progressing to tutorial section 3 of 3.

Zima: &quot;Three's a crowd.&quot;

Hitting an enemy with a high damage attack, or one aimed at the feet to knock them down, will cancel their action.

Cancelling enemy actions, and preventing yours from being cancelled, is crucial for success. There are also other actions that can cancel enemy actions.

Remember to check the description below for detailed information on the currently selected action.

Always evaluate all your options in battle and think long and hard on what would be the best course of action for the situation.

Now, use your full arsenal of actions to take down the three enemies confronting you.

*Battle end

This concludes the basic combat tutorial. You can access a glossary containing detailed explanations of all game mechanics and more at any time in the main menu.
Once you're used to the interface, you can choose an advanced display mode in the configuration menu, which shows all actions you can perform at once.

Remember to check out our Advanced VR Tutorial series for a more in-depth explanation of combat, including tips and tricks, available to all military personnel in the Headquarters. Featuring the beloved police force mascot MIZA!


You sift through his coat for any possible evidence. An {ITEM} catches your eye. Ultimately, you have control over what evidence backup gets to find. [[Raster: what do you think about choices in the game, even meaningless ones? Such as keeping or leaving a knife. This one might not do anything, but later ones could have minor dialogue impact.]] You pocket the {ITEM}.

You call HQ. 

Zima: “It’s finished.”

Chief: “Good work, Zima. We’ll talk in the morning. Get some sleep.”

You exhale. The cleanup crew will be here in a few minutes. The sooner you’re out of here the less time they’ll have for questions. You return to your ship and head home.

JUST HQ
COMMERCIAL CAPITAL

Zima: “I’ve called you all for a task of great importance. You all know I’m tracking the murder of Prince Ygne.”
Leto: “Death. Death of Prince Ygne. Unless you have news to share with us, Zima?”
Zima: “Security footage at the scene and a tip from a crime ring in Outer Rim. Foreman mentioned ‘The Illuminati’.”
Zima: “There’s a woman with a green ring we’re looking for, and whatever group she’s part of is bound to be here.”
Leto: “…That’s all you have to go on?”
Zima: (There’s a moment of silence. This isn’t going to be easy.)
Vesna: “Hey, where the hell is Veter?”
Osen: “Drunk in a ditch somewhere, no doubt!”
Padat: “She should not be missing this meeting.”
Leto: “Fill her in later! It’s her own damn fault.”
Leto: “*If* we want to find this ‘Illuminati’, Zima…”
Leto: “We would have to pay visits to each of the Dons.”
Vesna: “There’s three Dons in Commercial. Each one has a huge amount of money and influence over this town.”
Osen: “They pretty much own the place.”
Vesna: “If this goes all the way to the top like you think it does, the Dons will know about it. But it wouldn’t be easy. 
Padat: “We would be walking into hotspots of crime.”
Padat: “And how do we know that your hunch will be worth this risk?”
Zima: (And I hate to involve a group of irate Justs, but here we are.)
Zima: “You’re not wrong. I’ll do this on my own if I have to.”

*If the player has been killing a lot*
Leto: “Hang on. Let’s talk about your fighting, Zima. We’ve heard you’ve been doing a lot of it.”

Osen: “Yeah, like a lot! And killing too!”

Leto: “Maybe taking things too far for a servant of the people.”
Padat: “You will not make many friends with this kind of approach.”
Zima: (Vesna moves out from against the wall.)
Vesna: “I don’t think it’s so bad. Zima’s just doing her job right? Scaring all the widdle baddies straight?”
Leto: “Yeah, that kind of crazy says you know how to handle yourself.”
Leto: “But… play it a bit cooler from now on, ok Just?”
Zima: “…”
Zima: “Mh, I’ll keep it in mind.”
Zima: “Then with your minds ever so at ease, will you join me?”
}
*If the player has been arresting a lot*
Leto: “Normally, I wouldn’t join you. This hunch could put all our lives in danger. 
Leto: “But you’ve earned a reputation among Justs.”
Vesna: “I think you could be a little tougher on people. Just my preference.”
Osen: “No, you’ve been doing a good job!”
Padat: “It is not always easy to spare someone in the heat of battle, yet you do.”
Zima: “Thanks everyone. Then, will you join me?”
}

Zima: (Vesna nods.)
Vesna: “I’ll take any chance to make some noise in Commercial.”
Zima: (Osen and Padat step forward.)
Padat: “The Commercial Capital is large and loosely governed. We are the best help you will get.”
Osen: “We can show you around and help you meet the Dons! It’ll be fun!”
Zima: (Leto puts her fist in.)
Leto: “We’re Justs right? We gotta stick together.”
Zima: “Then we’re a team. Let’s pay a visit to these Dons.”


Vesna: “We’ll split up for recon and wait on you to start moving.”
Leto: “Find Veter for us, would you?”
Leto: “She’s probably off drinking somewhere.”
Zima: (One by one they take their leave. I let out a breath of air.)
Zima: “I’m hoping this hunch is right too.”
[When each section is completed, the corresponding Justs will return to HQ, allowing them to join on patrols. Zima can talk to them, with new dialogue, and I’ll add that once all the separate parts have been written.]

Zima: (I'm in the lobby. What should I do?)

CHECK THE ROOM
GO TO THE ARCHIVES
GO TO THE MARSHAL’S OFFICE
GO TO MY OFFICE
GO TO THE TRAINING GROUNDS
RETURN TO THE MAP

Check the room:
Zima: (This is the station for this colony’s law enforcement. Local Just will meet here, from time to time.)

Return to the map:
Zima: (I can always hunt for bounties from the map.)

Go to the archives:
(I'm in the archives. What should I do?)

CHECK THE ROOM
LOOK FOR INFORMATION ON THE SEWAGE SYSTEM
LOOK FOR FOOTAGE
RETURN TO THE LOBBY 

Check the room:
(A series of conductors flitter between server towers. I can use the main surveillance computer to check case records.)

Look for footage:
Before speaking with Marshal:
(I don't have any surveillance footage to check through.)

After speaking with Marshal:
(Checking the scene before the attack might give me some clues. Let's see what we can find.)

(I'm looking at the entrance to City Hall. Next to the street there's a crowd of people standing on the front grass.)

(Next to the crowd there's a woman with rich green hair, fidgeting.)

(She moves closer to the Prince’s car and her hands disappear in her coat. Then she’s back in the crowd. I can’t pick her out after that.)

Mission set to: “return to the area of attack”
(I’ll bet I can find some evidence on that street. That woman did something at the scene. I’m sure of it.)


Sewage system:
(I scan through the file. This colony’s sewage system has been maintained. But what about the system under City Hall?)

RECORDS OF TOWN HALL FROM 0900 TO 0910

&quot;INFORMATION REGARDING THE QUERY HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS STATION#FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE SET A LINK WITH#THE MAIN ARCHIVE IN THE CAPITAL.”

(Why would someone delete records of an old sewer system?)

[Zima can now ask the Marshal about the deleted records.]
}

You’re in the Marshal’s office. What do you do?
CHECK THE ROOM
CHECK THE BOARD
CHECK THE NEWS DISPLAY
TALK TO MARSHAL TORGUD
GO TO THE LOBBY

Check the room:
(Marshal’s office is a tornado of papers. Looking closer, there’s an organizational scheme to everything, as if placed by design. Above his desk is a coil pistol, nicked and scratched but polished to a sheen, no doubt from some days in the field.)

Check the board:
Before the attack:
(Current tracked crimes are strewn across the board, to be updated.)

After the attack:
(All the current crimes are placed in a folder, with notes on the attack plastered across the board.)

Check the news display:
If Before the attack:
(HEAT WARNING IN EFFECT FOR LOWER KINGDOM. Meteorologists are warning citizens of the Lower Kingdom to expect high temperatures and winds in excess of 60km/h throughout the weekend. This is the latest in a series of intense weather for the Lower Kingdom due to what the government has described as “due to a combination of increased material production and 

If after the attack:
(MOURNING PERIOD ESTABLISHED. A Statewide mourning period of a week has been established by King Vlast this following the tragic attack that took the life of the heir to the Throne, Ygne. While the cause of the attack is still a mystery and investigations are ongoing, the period…)

After Zima has investigated the black market:
(KING PROMISES JUSTICE. King Vlast has released his first official statement since the accident that took Prince Ygne. “Today I write to the people of my kingdom not as a ruler, but a father. Justice will be served to those that did this. For now, it is appropriate to grieve.”)

Talk to Marshal Torgud:
If Zima is supposed to be somewhere else:
(The Marshal is occupied with work. I should focus on mine.)

Normal:
(Marshal is sitting at his computer. One hand instinctively adjusting an empty cup of coffee.)

If after the attack &amp; Zima hasn’t checked archives (first time):
(Marshal is standing by his desk, massaging his hands. I have to wave to get his attention.)

Marshal: “Just! Good to see a capable head on this mess.”

Zima: “I want to know where I can find info on a particular kind of sewage system that may not be functioning anymore hear City Hall.”

Marshal: “We keep that kind of pre-structure information in the archives. Feel free to take a look.”

If after the attack &amp; Zima has checked archives (first time):
(I tell him the files on the sewer have been deleted. His face hardens before he gives out a nervous laugh.)

Marshal: “And I guess whoever did it thought we wouldn’t notice?”

Zima: “Then it’s a good thing I found it in time. You’re stretched thin, asking for help from the Capital…”

(It’s clear from Torgud’s look that he doesn’t want to be in this position anymore than I do. Shouldn’t push it.)

Zima: “What about Outer Rim’s Black Market?”

Marshal: “Mm. It’s possible someone there could trade in records. The Market disappeared after a raid a few months ago but they always nest somewhere else. I’ve got intel people trying to figure it out but--”

Zima: “--But my way is faster.”
[OBJECTIVE: Interrogate an agent or arrest a thug and ask about the Black Market]
}

If after the attack &amp; Zima has checked archives but hasn’t finished with the Black Market:
Marshal: “Just, how goes the investigation?”

Zima: “I haven’t finished with the Black Market. But I do have some questions.”
}

After Zima has investigated the Black Market:
(Marshal is speaking to a corporal and dismisses him once he notices me. I slide the disc across his desk.)

Zima: “Get in touch with central and let them know what’s going on. Run a background check on anyone entering or leaving the colony.”

Zima: “I’m going to the sewers to see who answers for this. If you don’t hear from me by stardown then tell the King what we’ve found here.”

Marshal: “Understood.”

Zima: “You’re a good man, Marshall. Don’t let me down.”

Zima: (He looks as if he’s about to say something, but instead puffs out his chest and salutes. I smile instead. Don’t want to make too much of an impression on him.)

ZIMA RETURNS TO LOBBY

Zima: (I think my time in the colony is up. If there is anything that needs to be done around here then I should end it now.)




ASK ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION:
ASK ABOUT POSSIBLE SUSPECTS
ASK ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF EVENTS
ASK ABOUT GANG ACTIVITY
ASK ABOUT OUTER RIM
SAY GOODBYE

Ask about the investigation:
Zima: “What leads do you have on the attack?”

Marshal: “Our first lead is a mechanic who worked on the Prince’s car before he arrived on the colony.”

Marshal: “The other being a suspicious woman we picked up on our cameras. You can view the footage in the Archive.”

Ask about possible suspects:
Zima: “Do we have any suspects in custody?”

Marshal: “No one, but I suppose there was an old woman that claimed she saw someone suspicious. It didn’t lead to anything.”

Zima: “Marshal. We can’t afford to overlook anything in this case. Give me her address.”

Marshal: “But Just, she’s probably only senile. Heck, she probably just wanted to be on the news...”

(I put my hands around the sides of his desk. Torgud is neither as smart or brave as he looks and he looks like neither.)

Zima: “Don’t waste my time Marshal.” 

Marshal: “Okay! I’ll send you her address.”

(I can now travel to see the old woman.)

Ask about the timeline of events:

Zima: “What about the timetable of the attack?”

Marshal: “Yes, I’ll send it to you after we’re done talking.”

Ask about gang activity:
Zima: “Aside from clearing the murder, I'm here to reassure the colonies that the King is watching over them. What else can I help with?&quot;

Marshal: “Trouble never ends for people on this colony. One of the larger gangs, the Nesti, has been rapidly growing and doing larger crimes. You’re free to help find out why.”

Zima: “I’ll add it to my list.”

Ask about Outer Rim:
Zima: “What is life like on the colonies? I haven’t left the capital in years.”

Marshal: “Yes, you were with the Core, weren’t you? I’ve heard stories--”

Zima: “I’m not here to listen about my past.”

Marshal: “Right. Things here have been different. Worse, really. The expansion set in the prior decades has reached us in the wrong way.&quot;

Marshal: “Too much growth and not enough control. It was a matter of time before something on this level happened. The Prince’s visit was supposed to signal a change, but I guess some people didn’t see it that way.”
}

Go to Zima’s office:

CHECK THE ROOM
CHECK THE RECORDS
CHECK DESK PHOTO
GO TO THE LOBBY
I’m in my office. What should I do?


Check the Room:
(Storage crates block out the windows and cover most of the walls. One of them is leaking packing peanuts onto the floor. I remember the moving crew leaving in a hurry. Could be a few more days until I get this place to myself.)
[after chapter 2]
(Despite everything that’s happened, this room is still the same. I should get a calendar, or something to make it more homely.) 

Check the Records:

CHECK THE INVESTIGATION FILES
READ NEW MESSAGES
TURN THE COMPUTER OFF
I turn on the computer. What should I do?

Check the investigation files:
(Here are the files for cases that are both opened and closed. Which should I read?)
CASE OF THE OUTER RIM GANG
CASE OF THE AUGMENTATION GANG

Case of the Rim Gang:
(“A local gang of augmentation dealers was stopped by local forces this Wednesday. The dealers were smuggling augs to farming employees.”)

(“They admitted that their merch came from the Confederacy. A joint effort with Confederacy authorities has been established, but nothing has come of it.”)

(The case’s status is [status].)

Case of the Aug Gang:
(“This gang has been responsible for targeted attacks against government landmarks in the Outer Rim. Our lead has told us that the gang has undergone a mutiny by two low-ranking members.”)

(“The gang has since been renamed ‘Machine’. The investigation continues.”)

(The case’s status is “[status]”.)

Read messages:
About the Investigations. - From: Your King

Investigations (available after attack):
“Zima. I hope everything is going well for you at the Outer Rim. We need to find out who’s behind this. I need you to find the real culprit. I want you to come meet me when you’ve found enough evidence on the attack.”

“There is also the matter of my son’s remains. You're the only one I trust to safely bring him home. Be safe. --Vlast”

If check desk photo:
(It’s a photo of the Outer Rim Just corps. They’re posed in some kind of celebration. Out of the dozen of them, I only recognize Marshal Torgud, although he looks younger.)

(I’m reminded of my old unit in the Capital. Some of them are still there, some are retired, some are dead. And I’m here.)
}

Training Grounds:
CHECK THE ROOM
TALK TO THE CORPORAL
CHECK THE EQUIPMENT
RETURN TO THE LOBBY
(I’m in the training grounds. What should I do?)

Check the room:
(Instead of a shooting gallery and field course, Outer Rim has made the contentious decision to focus on VR training. A sleepy-looking Corporal sits by a counter, to the side.) 

Talk to the corporal:
Before black market intel:
Zima: “Corporal, what can you tell me about the training room?”

(He snaps to attention. Either he’s desperate for someone to talk to, or he’s intimidated by a Just’s presence. Probably both.)

Corporal: “Just! Most of the personnel in HQ are out on missions right now. You know how busy Outer Rim has been. I’m safeguarding the equipment. You can train in VR if you want.”

After black market intel:
Zima: “Corporal. What do you know about the Black Market?”

Corporal: &quot;What? N-no, I just--”

Zima: “You’re not in trouble Corporal. This is larger than you.”

(He squirms in his chair for a moment.)

Corporal: “Alright, I’ll tell you. But can you keep this between us, please?”

(I can now travel to the Black Market from the map screen.)

Zima: “Thanks Corporal. Better hope it’s the worst thing I learn about you.”

Corporal: “...”

}

Check the equipment:
(The standard assortment of vests, helmets and artillery that one would expect in a combat force. Looks like the Justs in Outer Rim have to put up with MIZA, too.)

(Should I put the helmet on and touch up on my combat skills?)
[[combat training area shouldn’t need any rewrites]]
}

-=-=- Scene 6-=-=-=-
Zima: “What do you have for me?”

Coroner: “The initial blast destroyed a great part of his body. A blast this strong, whatever device they had, would be within a few feet of the Prince’s car.&quot;

Zima: “What else?”

Coroner: “We didn’t find anything from the bomb that matches our records. It’s homemade.”

(They could have bought a bomb. Sounds like they’re making a statement.)

Coroner: “Here’s a copy of the report, should you be returning to the scene of the accident.”

Zima: “Attack. It was an attack.”

Coroner: “...Understood, Lady Zima.”

( The area of the attack is still closed off, so I can gather some hard evidence myself. First I should share this with Marshal Torgud.)

[Objective: Meet the Outer Rim's Marshal.]


Morgue:
CHECK THE AREA
RETURN TO THE LOBBY
(I'm in the morgue. What should I do?)

Check the area:
(Despite the sterile appearance, the room is drenched with the smell of formaldehyde.)
&quot;OUTER RIM#2 DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK#OUTER RIM CENTRAL JUSTICE HEADQUARTERS' MORGUE&quot;

[[these areas have no purpose but I’ll keep it in this doc in case they get repurposed later]]

Go to the cells:
CHECK THE ROOM
CHECK THE PRISONERS
RETURN TO THE LOBBY
(I’m in the prison. What should I do?)

[[Need to make Marshal brush against Zima more, but ultimately be a good person, or just stand out more]]

Zima: (The path splits into three up ahead.)

LEFT PATH
MIDDLE PATH
RIGHT PATH

On first visit:
Zima: (Which path should I take?)

On repeated visits:
Zima: (I’m back at the junction. Which path should I take?)

Left path:
Zima: (Looks like this path ends with some rubble. I’ll head back.)

Middle path:
If unexplored:
Zima: (There’s a mountain of collected garbage. Much of it looks half-eaten and the stench is strong.)

Zima: “Hang on, is something glittering?”


Zima: (Well, nobody’s watching… should I pick through to get it?)

PLAY TRASH GAME? Y/N
}

If explored, but treasure not collected:
Zima: (That glittering… something is still taunting me through the mountain of trash. Should I go for it?)

PLAY TRASH GAME? Y/N
}

If explored, and treasure collected:
Zima: “I’ve got what I needed. Better preserve my sense of smell while I can.”
}

Right path:
Zima: (I hear movement. Two people.)
Zima: (If I approach, things could get hairy. Last chance to explore the prior tunnels.)
ADVANCE
RETURN

Advance:
Voice: “Oi, knock it off, yer blinding me! You know I’m no used to bright outside lights!”
Other Voice: “Shaddup Franko! I’m telling ya I heard something.”

Zima: “Freeze. You’re under arrest.”
Zima: (They stop, for a second, then throw the lamp into the water and dash down one of the tunnels.)

Voice: “It’s a Just!”

If discovered in the Black Market:
Another Voice: “We just heard about a bloody Just in the Market, didn’t we? Good thing I tagged along with ya!”
Franko: “Now, Just, I've no idea what you mind in our tiny business, but ya ain't leavin!”
Zima: “Let’s have at it then, you slags.”


Else:
Voice: “Shit, we shouldda brought backup!”
Franko: “Now, Just, I've no idea what you mind in our tiny business, but ya ain't leavin!”
Zima: “Let’s have at it then, you slags.”

*BATTLE* (two or three thugs dependent on the Market)

Zima: (The room is dark, dank and dilapidated. There’s a group of crates by the wall and a metal door. What should I do?)

LOOK AROUND THE ROOM
LOOK AT THUGS
LOOK AT CRATES
OPEN DOOR

Look around the room:
Zima: (We’re at some kind of dam. The door ahead must lead to a filtration room.)

Look at Thugs:
Zima: (Their upper bodies are covered in illegal augs. No wonder they hit so hard.)

Look at crates:
Zima: (Sealed wooden crates. Judging from the shipping labels these contain drugs.)

Open door:
Zima: (The rusted door gives resistance. I’m met with a gust of cool air and a bright room.)
Zima: (The air is clean, and there are a dozen people in masks and coats working on a vapor tank and some kind of crystal drug. There’s a large, outstanding man overseeing the work.)

G. Foreman: “Impressive, no? The name’s Foreman, G. FOREMAN!”
Zima: (He puts out an arm to shake and when I look down, he snaps it back.)
Foreman: “I’m a former Gunnery Colonel in the Rank. I’m here to slice myself a nice new piece of land.”
G. Foreman: “Me and an associate, we moved in here no more than half a year ago, and now we have the largest operation of drugs and augmentations this side of the Outer Rim.&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;You Kingdom peasants... One shout and you're already doing what you're told. It's pretty fucking great! Had I known how easy is to rule over you I'd have left the Rank long ago.&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;That whole meritocracy system... The straightest arrow goes the farthest... It's shit!
Zima: (He takes a moment to roll a shard of crystal between his fingers before crushing it.)
G. Foreman: “Now me? I’ve always preferred instant gratification.”
G. Foreman: &quot;In any case, Zima, is it? What brings you here?&quot;

Zima: &quot;The murder of Prince Ygne. You're behind the attack, but someone's backing you.&quot;
Zima: &quot;This whole operation, the drugs, the augmentations, the trade of it around here. It doesn't come from the Kingdom. I want a name.&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;I may be bullheaded, but I'm not stupid. They'll kill me if I tell you. I didn't leave the Rank to die in your piece of shit State.&quot;
Zima: &quot;You're gonna die anyway, Colonel, so at least die with honor, for the Rank.&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;Don't. Look at her eyes, look through the augmentations, that pent up rage...&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;You win, I'll tell you what you need to know. I win, I'll cave your skull in.&quot;
Zima: &quot;Bigger trash than you has tried.&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;That’s the spirit Kid, let it all out.&quot;

*BOSS BATTLE*

Zima: “You ready to tell me who’s behind this, or do I hit you again?”
G. Foreman: “*cough*”
G.Foreman “...I like you Kid! You got sand. I’ll tell you something.”
G. Foreman: “The Woman has a ring. She controls everything. And what we’re doing here, is really important to her.”
Zima: “Where is she? Is she from the Confederacy?”
G. Foreman: “Heh, you peasants… She’s been on your beloved Kingdom all your life.”
G. Foreman: “She’s been here since before the Fall. Your precious Commercial Capital, she’s bigger than…”
G. Foreman: “Heh... My men already left.&quot;
Zima: &quot;Wha-&quot;
G. Foreman: &quot;Quit while you're ahead, Zima, that's what I did...&quot;
Zima: (I notice a high-pitched whine coming from somewhere in the lab. Maybe a little too late. The blast sends me into the wall. Rib feels fractured. Luckily my augs had warmed up from the fight. Shouldn’t feel much for a while. There’s not much left of the lab, the crystal or Foreman. I limp out and call HQ and my car. Sun’s starting to set.)

CHAPTER 2 END

Change into an undercover outfit:
Zima: (I return to my car and switch outfits.)
Stay in Just attire:
Zima: (It might be good to impose some respect around here.)

Zima: (Deeper into the alleys and tunnels is a group of more 'exotic' stalls. One of these vendors could lead me to information. What should I do?)

On return without the map:
Zima: (I'm back at the exotic stalls. What should I do?)
On first return with the map:

GO TO THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE SHOP

GO TO THE ILLEGAL EQUIPMENT SHOP
GO TO THE REPAIR SHOP
GO TO THE ARCADE CABINET
 
Currency exchange shop:
First visit:
Zima: (Despite the neighborhood, this store is clean and bright, with a service robot behind a counter.)
Jock0.1: &quot;Welcome, I'm Jock0.1, A.I. keeper of the Regal Royal, the premium exchange rate house in this whole rotten market.&quot;
Zima: &quot;I wan-&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;Before your questions, a warning that any and all attempts at robbery/vandalism/criminal activity will be met with deadly and decisive force.&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;You may now make your enquiry.&quot;
 
Return visit:
Zima: (As I step inside, Jock0.1 swivels to face me and bows.)
}
EXCHANGE CURRENCIES
ASK FOR INFORMATION

Exchange currencies:
Jock0.1: &quot;CONNECTING TO GLOBAL CURRENCY DATABASE...&quot;
*Currency exchange menus*
Jock0.1: &quot;Thank you for using our service. What else can I assist you with?&quot;
}
 
Ask for info:
Zima: &quot;Is there anything you can tell me about the current exchange rates?&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;Jock0.1 isn't allowed to discuss exchange rates with officials of the law. Our apologies, fascist pig.&quot;
Wearing the undercover suit and not discovered:
Jock0.1: &quot;Certainly, commoner. Royals (R$), the official currency of the Kingdom, are not only used as a standard, but are also heavily sanctioned, and therefore have a fixed value compared to the other currencies.&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;Dollars ($$) are the most accepted legal currency outside of the Kingdom. Its value fluctuates lightly, as it is a very strong coin. Dollars are accepted at high-class stores.&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;Lastly, drillos (Dr$) are a new and exciting currency used in some shops around these parts. Its value fluctuates wildly, so you can make a lot of money exchanging for them.&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;These are all the currencies our store offers. Keep in mind their numerical value is roughly the same, so 100 royals are as good as 100 dollars or 100 drillos.&quot;
Zima: &quot;Wow, so I can play the market!&quot;
 
Ask about the colony:
Zima: &quot;What can you tell me about the colony?&quot;
Jock0.1: &quot;Jock0.1 isn't programmed to be a chat responsive A.I., SORRY.&quot;
 
Leave:
Zima: (Jock0.1 gives an exaggerated wave and a wiggle.)
}
 
Curio Shop:
First visit:
Zima: (Lanterns and gold heat the tent in a skin of flame. Trinkets and china are covered in a layer of dust.)
Shopkeeper: &quot;Why hello Dearie. What brings you to my store of oddities?&quot;
Zima: &quot;Information.&quot;
Shopkeeper: &quot;Ah! That is more valuable than anything material one can carry.&quot;
Zima: &quot;I'm looking for schematics of the colony's sewage system.&quot;
Shopkeeper: &quot;Hm, yes, I think I have that. Hang on a minute.”
Zima: (The Shopkeeper moves past a curtain in the back, and comes back with a bundle of scrolls.)
Shopkeeper: &quot;Now let's see--here it is. An old print of the sewage system first implemented 88 years ago, a subsystem no longer in use since the implementation of nanites in the air.&quot;
Shopkeeper: &quot;That'll be 500 royals, dearie... or 300 drillos, to save me the exchange hassle. That robot down the street won't let me or any of my cohorts back in.&quot;
Zima: (I'd better not ask why.)
Zima: “A bit expensive, don’t you think?”
Shopkeeper: “Supply and demand, my friend.”
BUY
TRY INTIMIDATING HER
DON'T BUY
 
Buy:
PAY 500 ROYALS
PAY 300 DRILLOS
RETURN
 
Pay 500 royals:
Zima has the money:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Royals, really? Well, more money for me. Thank your Dearie.&quot;
}
Zima doesn't have enough:
Shopkeeper: &quot;I'm sorry, I'll only accept less if you pay me in drillos. Try your luck at the exchange shop, maybe today the rates will be somewhat even.&quot;
}
Pay 300 drillos:
Zima has the money:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Thank you, Dearie. Keep it nice and dry.&quot;
}
Zima doesn't have the money:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Sorry Dearie, you'll have to come back when you have more drillos.&quot;
}
 
Intimidate her:
Zima: “You should know, I’m one of the King’s Just, and I’m not getting swindled like some commoner. Cut me a deal, and I’ll keep this store open.”
Shopkeeper: “Shut me down and another store is going to pop up in my place. You can’t cut down an infection like Black Market that easily, hah!”
Zima: (Well, it was worth a shot. Hope she keeps that info to herself.)
*Zima’s cover is blown*
 
Leaving the store with the map:
Zima: (Now that I have the map, I should check in with the Marshal before I check out the sewers.)
Returning to the store with the map:
Zima: (I've got the map already. Don't want to raise any undue suspicion.)
Returning to the store before buying the map:
Shopkeeper. &quot;Ah, the archaeologist. So, did you get the money?&quot;
 
First leaving the store after Zima’s cover is blown (add this line in front of any other lines, in case the player blew cover but also bought the map.)
Zima: (I’m back at the exotic stalls. But where did everyone go?)
Zima: (I hope I didn’t blow my cover…)
}
 
Arms shop:
First visit:
Zima: (The store is lined with barred shelves containing rifles, handguns, cattle prods and explosives.)
 Then the Shopkeeper will say something:
Before getting the map:
Undetected:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Hey, I sell weapons and augmentations, legal AND illegal! Find something you like, and I'll give you a nice price.&quot;
Detected:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Hey, we only sell state-approved items here, for a fair price. Drillos only.&quot;

Strength +1:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Pushups and protein not doing enough for you? Upping your Strength will cost 500 royals, or 450 drillos. What do you say?&quot;
 
Endurance +1:
Shopkeeper: &quot;I think you're plenty healthy already, but if you want to be more, I won't judge! Upping your Endurance will cost 500 royals, or 450 drillos. What do you say?&quot;
 
Intelligence +1:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Feeling slow, or easily distracted? You could go on vacation; you know? Upping your Intelligence will cost 500 royals, or 450 drillos. What do you say?&quot;

Shopkeeper: &quot;Whew, that should do you! None of this work is within Kingdom regulations, mind you, so don't go around telling just anybody.&quot;
 
Zima doesn't have enough cash:
Shopkeeper: &quot;Sorry Miss, looks like you're short on funds. Try taking some goods into the Exchange Shop.&quot;

Ask for information:
Zima: “Any tips for buying in Black Market?”
Shopkeeper: “Don’t haggle if you don’t live here. Shopkeepers can smell outsiders, and they’re going to string you on any sales. Except me of course, hah ha!”
Ask about the colony:
Zima: &quot;What can you tell me about the state of the colony?
Shopkeeper: &quot;What's to say? We live on the scraps of the Kingdom. Between the Prince's death and everything else, I think things are going to change pretty soon.&quot;

Zima: “So this is the place.”

Corporal: “Yes Sir! I mean... Madam... Just! I...&quot;

Zima: “Dismissed.”

INVESTIGATE THE FIRST AREA:


Zima: (This is where the Prince’s car exploded. If there’s any place to start, it’s here.)

Zima: (Looks like the bomb was planted on the left side of the car. According to the report the blast would have been bigger, if the explosives were made with better components and craftsmanship. Still did its job.)

if (investigated the second area)
		{
			-Zima:&quot;(If there was anything else that was important in the explosion area it was destroyed in the blast. What should I do now?)&quot;;
		}
		else
		{
			-Zima:&quot;(If there was anything else that was important in the explosion area it was destroyed in the blast. Better take a look at the area where the remains of the passengers landed.)&quot;;
}

INVESTIGATE THE SECOND AREA:

Zima: (On the right side of the road is where the debris and remains landed.)

Zima: “But an explosion this big should have sent things further. How faulty was that bomb?”

Zima: (A flickering light catches my eye. There’s a piece of shrapnel hugging the curb.)

Zima: (Hm. It’s not the kind of shrapnel common to dirty bombs. Maybe HQ can tell me where it comes from.)

Zima: “Someone would have noticed a bomb under the car, unless it was planted just before the explosion. If that’s the case, it might be on camera footage. HQ would have that tape.”
}

LEAVE THE AREA
If fully investigated:
RETURN TO TOWN

Else:
Zima: (I should keep checking this area. There must be clues around.)


Second Visit:

Zima: (This time I move to the right side of the town hall. The spot I saw on camera. What should I do?)

CHECK THE AREA:
Zima: (Without the car in view, the city hall is eerily quaint. There’s a camera above the astroturf, and an alley down the street.)

CHECK THE CAMERA:
Zima: (It doesn’t look like it’s been tampered with.)

CHECK THE ALLEY:
Zima: (The alley ends abruptly. But the woman in the video escaped through here…)
Zima: (I run my palms over the wall. Then listen against the concrete. There’s a faint sound of running water. Could our culprit have used a sewage system?)
Zima: “I should ask the Marshal at HQ if he knows of a sewage system.”


Last Visit

Zima: (I’m back at the alleyway.)
Zima: (This is my last stop in Outer Rim. I hope I’m well prepared…)


I’M READY:
Zima: (Okay, according to the map there should be a human-sized sewage pathway over here. Time to make some noise.)
Zima: (I set the charge and dive behind a tree.)
*BANG*
Zima: “Should have brought earplugs.”

Zima: “Osen… what kind of codename is that?”
Announcer: “An orphan from the Confederacy, she enjoys long walks on the beach and razors in her cereal. The silent but deadly: Pallett!”
Padat: “…”
Announcer: “And the leader of the bunch, the self-proclaimed ‘Petite Princess of Pain’, she is: Olsen!”
Osen: “That’s me!”
Announcer: “And they are: The Unjust!”
Zima: (The crowd roars. They don’t expect us to live through the first round. We’ll surprise them.)
[Line of dialogue for our villains]
*battle start! First battle is nice and easy, introducing the player to Padat and Osen’s combat abilities. In fact, the two of them handle the first fight mostly by themselves. There is a list of battle quips for each character in a separate file.*

Announcer: “And The Unjust take the first round!”
Osen: “Good job, Unjusts!”
*transition to waiting room*

Zima: “That’s some technique the two of you have. I’ve never seen either of you fight.”
Padat: “We have always worked as a pair, since we were children.”
Osen: “Never needed anyone else’s help!”
Zima: “Until now, that is.”
Zima: (There’s a pause.)
Padat: “Dame Zima, it is you who needs our help.”
Osen: “But don’t worry about it, this arena will be a breeze!”
Padat: “For the next round, could you focus on distracting the enemy for us?”
Announcer: “…And the next round is about to begin!”
Padat: “Thank you, Dame Zima.”
Zima: “I… wait!”

*Transition to arena*
Announcer: “The Unjust took the first round, but how will they stand against…. []!”
[Line of dialogue for our villains]
*battle two, start! This one is as easy as the first round. Padat and Osen and the enemies have high speed stats and the enemies focus on attacking Zima.*
Announcer: “This is a surprise folks! The Unjust have taken the second round!”
Osen: “We kick butt!”

*Transition to waiting room*

Osen: “Okay, fine. We can ask them to change our team name.”

Zima: “Strategies for the next match: Osen, if you cover me with suppressing fire, I can get in close and...”
Osen: “…And I say to him, I say ‘that’s my pistol chamber!’”
Padat: “Oh Osen, you crack me up.”

Padat: “Zima, you are right. We are sorry.”
Osen: “But Padat-“
Padat: “No, Osen.”
Zima: (Osen pouts, and flicks between us as if looking for an answer. She lets out her breath and deflates.)
Osen: “A long time ago I promised to protect someone. I thought that was special. But Justs have to mean that towards everyone.”
Zima: “But I don’t-“
Osen: “I protect you and you protect me, got it?”
Zima: “Sure.”

Zima: (Osen runs her hands down the barrel and makes some mock gun sounds.)
Osen: “Pow. Pow.”
Osen: “The frame is carbon polymer, and It’s modded with a light trigger pull. Even a girl with fingers like these can make mincemeat out of ya.”
Second time (loop between 1 and 2):
Zima: “Why's your rifle named Ostry?”
Osen: “That’s the name of the first person I killed with her, silly!”

Ask about Prince:

Ask about Padat:
Zima: “What’s the deal between you and Padat anyway?”
Osen: “Did you know Padat didn’t know how to speak Commoner as a girl? She’s from the Confederacy and wasn’t supposed to become a Just.”

Don Moss: “Your great and powerful Don Moss can grant you one wish.”
Don Moss: “So! What will it be?”
Zima: (Osen looks like she has a bright idea, but Padat puts a hand on her shoulder.)
Zima: “This might sound vague, but we need help tracking a woman who’s part of the Illuminati.”

Don Moss: “Oh dear me, hee ha ha. I do hope you know what you are doing.”
Osen: “We beat your stupid challenge, didn’t we!”
Don Moss: “Ha hee. Okay, let’s smile and wave for the crowd.”

            <Text>Chapter 6 ideas

-During the fight with the King we can make him a little nasty. Lines like “I had hoped that someday you would bear the Prince’s children”
“You have truly disappointed me Zima”
“I have no use for a dog that will not obey its master”
“Do you know what you would be without me? A filthy urchin, begging for food. I created you.”

In the dialog up to this point you can have a hint of a father/daughter language, and sever it during the fight.

What happens to a monarch with no heir? Mao created a cult of personality to try and keep his image lasting forever and also to protect his form of government—what will King do?

Zima has a big showdown with the boss and survives/dies knowing that even if she didn’t win, she did all she could and that’s enough.

Reveal that Zima was much more violent in the past, brought to protect the king as a sort of rabid bulldog, either rejects or accepts her past

King doesn't care if Zima knows the whole plan, because he still believes her to be loyal to him (will need a scene where he realizes Zima isn't with him)

When Zima is trying to convince the King, make it clear that she thinks Illuminati is bad but he's not being any better

King v Zima: bring back the dog line, &quot;so, the hand that feeds bites the master.&quot;. Always equate Zima &amp; King's relationship like a pet and master

“I’m not ready to die like a dog”

maybe King made her an orphan because he saw her potential. The doubt being planted when visiting her town and the King confirming it (shit, this is turning into MGS2)

Make final wave battle playable, hold out survival that you can or can't win. When Justs are in combat they can do the same battle techniques as Zima albeit with very different stats (and combat strengths/weaknesses)

Who would confront Zima about her past? King? Illuminati? Army leader? Zima failed to protect someone who had protected her many times, that person dies and because of that person’s work she is praised by the King and becomes his closest Just.

King would try to hurt her emotionally with this information, but by then Zima has conquered it. She confronts this by saving the Prince who was thought to be dead, and learning to work with others (Justs, Prince). Has accepted that all you can do is your best and can’t hold yourself to anything higher.

“It’s a good offer, you should take it. On the other hand, you’re making me want to fight some more.”

Fighting Leto - she’s a psychic Just who played cards with you, so her stuff would be things like debuffs, reading you mind (reacting to your battle intent before it happens),
forcing you to take an action and you need to prepare for it
-e.g. “you will be forced to go prone in two turns”

Zima: (A metal given by my old Chief. It’s made of bronze and embossed with a charge of the Kingdom, a headless eagle.)
}

Go to the training grounds:

CHECK THE ROOM
If haven’t spoken to him before:
TALK TO THE MARSHAL
Else:
TALK TO MARSHAL KARL
}
GO TO THE ENTRANCE HALL
Zima: (I’m in the training grounds. What should I do?)

Check the room:
Zima: (It’s a training field that annexes HQ. The Cadets are polishing their equipment, supervised by the Marshal.)

Talk to the Marshal (Marshal Karl):
On first time talking:
Zima: (Karl is a retired Captain. Now he just trains recruits, but he takes his work in stride.)
Karl: “Lady Zima! Head of the King’s Justice. An honour to have you on my grounds. What can I help you with?”

else :
Karl: “Lady Zima. What can I help you with?”
}

ASK ABOUT THE HEADQUARTERS
ASK ABOUT THE BROKERING DEAL
ASK ABOUT THE KING
ASK ABOUT THE NEW RECRUITS
SAY GOODBYE

Ask about the headquarters:
Zima: “Is everything in order at the HQ?”

Karl: “Yes, although the others are anxious about the Prince’s meeting with the Confederacy.”

Ask about the brokering deal:
Zima: “What’s your opinion of the King’s brokering deal?”

Karl: “Those are matters beyond myself, Lady Zima. I trust in the King and the Prince.”

Ask about the King:
Zima: “How do you feel about the King’s mental state?”

First time:
Karl: “Lady Zima! I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that. The King is fine. I know it’s been a while since you’ve seen him, but don’t listen to the rumors.”

If later:
Karl: “Lady Zima, I know it’s been a while since you’ve seen him, but don’t listen to the rumors.”

Ask about the new recruits:
If now:
Zima: “How are the trainees?”

Karl: “Could be better. The latest batch of recruits don’t keep up pace, and their loyalty to the King is… disappointing.”

If later:
Zima: “How are the trainees coming along?”

Karl: “They respond well to simulated fighting, but shirk at the real thing. This group isn’t much, I’m afraid.”

Karl: “I bet they would respond well to a few minutes in the ring with you Lady Zima--if they could last that long, of course.”

TAKE ONE ON
TAKE TWO ON
TAKE THREE ON
DECLINE

After every choice to fight:
Karl: “Excellent, Lady Zima! I’m sure this is just what these cadets need. Take these rubber bullets for the exercise. And, don’t go too easy on them.”

BATTLE!

After a successful battle:
Karl: “Excellent job Lady Zima. That should help them build some character. Here’s a little something for your help. And feel free to show these recruits the what-for anytime.”

On failing the battle:
Karl: “Hey, don’t get full of yourselves out there! Count yourselves lucky that Lady Zima went easy on you! I won’t be so nice.”

Say goodbye:
Karl: Good luck with the investigation, Lady Zima.
}

Go to the Restraining Cells:

CHECK THE ROOM
CHECK THE CELL DISPLAYS
CHECK THE PRISONERS
RETURN TO THE ENTRANCE HALL

Zima: “I’m in the Restraining Cells. What should I do?”

Check the room:
Zima: “These cells hold smugglers, robbers and criminal suspects. I’d say I’m responsible for a quarter of the people here.”

Check the cell displays:
Zima: “There are detention blocks ahead. The detainees inside are without parole until their investigations are finished.”

Check the prisoners:

Zima: “Right now there’s nobody in these cells relevant to my current cases.”
}

Go to the Interrogation Room:

CHECK THE ROOM
CHECK THE NEWS DISPLAY
TALK TO MARSHAL MOTHRS
RETURN TO THE ENTRANCE HALL

Zima: “I’m in the Interrogation Room. What should I do?”

Check the room:
Zima: “This is where interrogations and profiling work are done. Investigations with suspects and arrested criminals take place here.”

Check the news display:
First:
News Feed: “PRINCE TO BROKER PEACE DEAL WITH CONFEDERACY. It's expected that the trade deal ensures a cleaner and more efficient conversion rate in future resources exchanges between the Confederacy and the Kingdom.&quot;

Then later:
News Feed: &quot;EX-RANK SOLDIERS FORMING GANGS ON THE OUTER RIM? Several reports indicate that the gangs of the Outer Rim of the Kingdom's space are gaining members from the State of The Rank. Should it be true, this would be a black omen in crime related activities in said zones.&quot;

Talk to Marshal Mothrs:
First time initiating conversation:

Zima (Marshal Mothrs is the lead prosecutor of the capital. Despite his title he’s a fairly casual talker. And well loyal.)

Zima: “Greetings, Marshal. The King has asked me to leave for the Outer Rim colonies. I trust you'll keep everything in order.&quot;

If wearing silly clothes:
Mothrs: “Heavens, Zima, you look like a mess. Come back when you’re properly dressed.”

If wearing other outfit:
Mothrs: “Just, good to see you. Also, odd choice of clothing. What do you need?”

If wearing professional outfit:
Mothrs: “Just, good to see you. What do you need?”

ASK ABOUT THE AUGMENTATION GANGS
ASK ABOUT THE MURDER CASE
ASK ABOUT THE BROKERING DEAL
ASK ABOUT THE KING
SAY GOODBYE

Ask about the augmentation gangs:
Zima: “What can you tell me about the aug deals and gangs in the Capital?”

Mothrs: “All of our investigations are leading to one provider that we can’t coax out of hiding. I’ll get Xeed to send you more details.”

Ask about the murder case:
Zima: “What happened to the murder of the socialite?”

Mothrs: “The King has made it a priority to figure that out. We need to figure out just what kind of foul play took place. I’ll let you know if we need help.”

Ask about the brokering deal:
Zima: “Did the King issue special protection orders for today’s deal?”

Mothrs: “We suggested it, but the Prince has his own protection, and insisted that he feels safe.”

Ask about the King:
Zima: “Did the King say anything else about the deal?”

Mothrs: “No, but I could tell he doesn’t have a good feeling about it. He’s even less composed than usual.”

Zima: “Keep faith in the King, Mothrs.” 

Mothrs: “Just… consider what he asks of you.”

Zima: “That’s not my job.”

Zima: (Mothrs stops clicking the pen in his hand for a moment, then softens. He seems eager to change the subject.)

Say goodbye:
Mothrs: “Good luck, Just.”

If there has been an accident:
Corporal: “Mothrs, Zima, there has been an accident!”

Mothrs: “The meeting--there has been an accident!”

Zima: (We move to the entrance hall where a crowd of employees have gathered around a monitor.)

Reporter: “As we have reported there has been an accident at the brokering deal between the Kingdom and the Confederacy.”

Reporter: “Officials are reporting that an explosion went off inside the building. Multiple casualties have been confirmed but none have been identified.”

Zima: “I need to go there, now.”

Corporal: “Hang on Zima. I received a message from the Palace before I arrived. There’s one other thing the public doesn’t know. The Prince is dead.”

Mothrs: “Shit… what does this mean for the treaty?”

Corporal: “Nothing good.”

Zima: (I try to say something but the words don’t come. I sit down, slowly. There is a cloud over me, like when I was young. I think of the Prince, the King. The Kingdom. And then I know there is no time left to think like this.)

Could we have tools to track playtesting data? Like number of deaths and where, play time of battles vs everywhere else. Could be useful for balancing.


Three dialogue choices, because two suggests one is better than the other and four is two many. Think of it as rock paper sissors.
- Accept: continue the flow of conversation, be cooperative
- Reject: go on attack, you've had enough of this nonsense
- Deflect: change topic, leave conversation, a joke option but not the tone of a joke so the scene isn't ruined.
You should use a loop when the conversation is circling around in its current intensity / stakes, and then leave the loop when the conversation has escalated. You should also offer the player a &quot;trapdoor&quot; to exit the loop, and escalate the scene to continue forward.</Text>

            <Text>INTRO IDEAS

here a idea for the prologue:
&gt;King nationalist speech against the other countries
&gt;the speech finish, and we have zima watching it trough a tv at the headquarters (some monologue from zima talking about it)
&gt;Zima receives a call from the commander
&gt;commander appears and set up about the situation (we can introduce the justs, a little more about the kingdom, and how the world works)
&gt;commander talks about they discovered where is the hq from on the revolutionary groups, and how the mission is gonna happen
&gt;commander gives the new tecnology to zima use on this mission
&gt;mission happens (battle tutorial)
&gt;leader is arrested
&gt;zima and the commander in
terrogates the leader, either commits suicide or another Just kills him
&gt;zima returns to home
&gt;change to 3rd person pov, king talking with the prince, and the prince telling that what he's gonna do the next day, it checks with what the leader said (big death flag)
&gt;chapter 1 starts

[It's like FFVII: Fire escape is tedious but safer, elevator is riskier but faster. Player can set which floor they want to arrive on?]
Another agent here that Zima doesn't know about?

The guards already know to expect Zima. This worries her because she was supposed to have the element of surprise. Later she hears something about two intruders in the building. Then finds the dead bodies and afterward Vesna. At some point you get to talk to one of the foreign soldiers? Or at least eavesdrop on a conversation. You can talk to Vesna briefly before she leaves and Zima gets a small exploration segment before defeating the leader who Vesna kills (think the Russians in Resident Evil 3). Seeing the power of another Just could be done similarly to Roche in FF7R, so she wants to know Zima's rank and test her power. Maybe they duel in Chapter 3.

&quot;Thanks to you I've been on a goose chase all over this damn kingdom.&quot;
Vesna trying to piss Zima off, make her lose her cool. Zima gives in and they fight, Vesna wants to test her strength because she desires Zima's position, Zima giving into her anger (briefly). Before realizing that it's the wrong place to put it.

villain in intro could be a more important character to the story (think Turks in ff7, they tie in with other chars)

Should there be civilians? There shouldn't be corpses of civilians because the rebels aren't that bad. Proper civs allow for conversation, if not then the player should be able to talk to someone else like another Just if we go that route.

OH! Vagrant Story intro. People have been taken hostage in this castle, Ashley's cover is blown, awesome setup for the rest of the game. 

The King hopes to wage a war against the Illuminati and hopes for Zima to fail in the intro, for things to spiral out of control and civvs to die, Just to kill all the baddies and tensions to escalate between nations. But because she does such a good job he figures he needs a different strategy and decides to fake the Prince's death. So these are foreigners who have by proxy been encouraged by the Illuminati, and also the King, to attack, since it benefits both of them.

Other Just gets involved with the fight, makes it so you start the boss off with less HP 

So far we got:


Penthouse is owned by a diplomat of the foreign kingdom, or a rich immigrant. Terrorists are forcibly taking him back.
His penthouse is decorated with stuff that characterizes this other nation
Zima is supposed to rescue him. Does Vesna kill the terrorist leader, or the captive? Either one could know about the plan. It probably makes more sense for Vesna to kill the leader.

Only thing is, Zima also barely follows the rules. She’s supposed to be the loose cannon, and Vesna is supposed to be one of the voices of reason against Zima when she’s risking lives on a hunch, and then going off on her own in Chapter 4. 

Let’s assume Vesna blows Zima’s cover, shows you the extent of the Just’s power, you get to talk to her in the intro, you duel in chapter 3

Have something where Zima is attacked and should lose her life but is saved by augs (to show that she’s more than human). Then you get into a fight and get to play as her

So you explore, break into the penthouse and look around, your cover is blown and Zima gets shot or something but she’s ok due to augs, you get into a fight, explore and talk, another fight then you go to the roof and there’s a boss fight, Vesna demonstes her power and blows up the leader or captive, end intro.

Need to guide Ithiro on how to connect rooms

Maybe, penthouse is okay as long as you aren’t wasting time in bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, the places you also spend in Zima’s apartment. And Bressan can focus the background visuals on other things.

So you emerge onto the roof. There’s a skylight but it’s too dangerous? Or maybe that’s an alternate way in that has you fighting more people? Idk maybe we shouldn’t even offer that if it doesn’t make narrative sense.

Let’s assume you take a fire escape. You sneak into some upper hallways with bedrooms and because you don’t have the element of surprise, Zima gets shot or stabbed but is ok, and you get a tutorial battle. Then you move into the penthouse itself, get a chance to talk to Vesna, she runs off, you get into another fight, you find the hostage, run to the roof and fight the boss, Vesna blows up and you escape.

Maybe there’s a SWAT4 mission approp for this? Like the fancy office level.

“just make a cool outside staircase that leads from the balcony to the helipad
it's a penthouse it has all sorts of cool shit”

“You could do it like the action movies
like make her climb from outside
or just dropping with perfect precision from a helicopter
remember you got cyberpunk tech to make it work
maybe she could just walk in, simply hacking all the cameras on her way”

“but the more modern cameras can't, and that's for when we want to make them relevant for a scene
maybe a disguide could work?
she already disguises herself in a later scene
in the black market”

“we could make it into a thing she can do well, disguises”

Re: Zima’s powers being unveiled in the intro:
“and the excuse is that she's keeping up her disguise”

Hey, if Angel’s ‘thing’ can be disguises and that works…


Keep in mind what areas are in the palace (immediately after Zima’s place) to avoid repetition

Zima’s:
Kitchen
Bathroom
Bedroom
Living Room

Palace:
Throne room
Den

Penthouse:
Living room


————————

Zima jumps from the ship onto the helipad

Except there’s nothing interesting that can happen on a helipad, the first room should be built for exploration
  And in general the game adopts a slower pace where you explore at your leisure. But in the intro Zima shouldn’t be slowing down. At best we can have some exploration in an upper floor room like a library, but even then Zima shouldn’t be slowing down to investigate.

We could have Zima looking around the ship before the mission starts but that’s not too interesting?

I think this is a timeline problem, where I want everything to be time consistent, but there’s nothing interesting on the helipad
So maybe there should be some kind of flash forward to the inside, where we can give the player a fight and then a room to explore

Could have some dialogue with the Marshal in the intro to establish things a little more

We did this in the original intro, just go for something more in that tempo until Zima arrives in a room or has a fight

Zima starts off on helipad, runs down staircase and into a bedroom that you can explore before (there could be a reason for exploring the bedroom like camera equipment) but any choice will put you in a fight. The scuffle alerts the rest of the building to your presence. Returning to the hall has you fighting a group of people. When you go downstairs there’s a group of bodies and you can look around a bit. Moving to the dining room has you talking to Vesna, who is looking for the hostage. You enter the conjoining room and the robot goes off to the roof and so does Vesna. Zima follows up and you team up to take down the mech.

Need to have more stuff to examine

            <Text>CHAPTER 1 IDEAS

Meet with the Prince in person at first, have him help Zima in some way be it through combat, giving her an item or plot direction so the player can establish a bond
Make it so Zima offers to protect the Prince but Prince + King turn it down. So King can feel guilty, and Zima can believe that she should have been better
Maybe this ties in with Zima’s arc--learning that she can’t do everything by herself, can’t be perfect and only by working with others can the world be made better (also a rejection of Monarchy, one ruler is no longer needed)

Meet with the Prince in the castle, he gives Zima some sweet item/ability, maybe winky flirtiness, leaves for the meeting. Convo with King is unaffected because he doesn't tell Zima about leaving for the treaty so as to not argue with the lady.

Zima meets with King and while he’s in a meeting Prince chats with her, doesn’t mention that he’s off to the treaty because he doesn’t want Zima to fuss. Maybe they have a little fight? He can give her an item/ability. 

Add a bit in Zima's apartment about her being beat up, showering washes off some blood and she mentions her bruises, etc

King will mention Zima's failure from the intro but forgive her, Prince won't mind. Here they will talk about what was foreshadowed by the rebel leader.

In Zima’s apartment she keeps plants. Hot Fuzz and Armitage III. She likes the routine of watering the plant everyday, how it needs her,  doesn’t talk, etc. Player can water the plant in ch1 and Zima will comment on it later on in the game.</Text>

            <Text>Justs: see Zima as royal guard dog, not the strongest Just but favoured by the King. Even if they believe Zima have Prince tell them off and make them respect her. Later on they can tease Prince and Zima about their relationship, Zima is popular with royalty (or maybe they concede that she’s popular for a reason)

Illuminati leader: Patriot AI, Helios etc. Could have some kind of stutter or speech gimmick (can we get a different font?) oh btw should ppl have different coloured font?
-Sees army leader and violence as a necessary evil, things have gotten too out of hand and it regrets not acting sooner. Regardless, more lives are saved because of these actions. Zima gets to accuse it of incompetency for this.
-Neutral towards King and Prince, understands their situation and considers them valuable pawns. Suggests even keeping the kingdom as a figurehead but removing all power (which King and Prince disregard). The royalty of course hate Illuminati.

“You can’t cut yourself off—”
“Prince. I don’t want to share my feelings. I don’t want to open up. I want to find the guy that killed such-and-such and I’m gonna look him in the eye.”
“Then what?”
“Then I’m gonna share my feelings.”

Club scene:
Zima goes to bartender, asks if he’s seen anything suspicious, dangerous, out od the ordinary
“Don’t worry, the real lookers don’t money in until around 11”
Zima strikes up a conversation with a regular at the bar that’s flirty and revealing of both their characters, but this character ties in in some way to the plot ideally. Or this is the other Just.</Text>

            <Title>Plot synopsis</Title>
            <Text>
*Backstory:

-The Illuminati is a secret organization that has existed since time immemorial. Their goal is to guide mankind through its evolution, putting a stop to anything that'd send it backwards or stagnate it. Their members are many and their influence is great, but much about them is shrouded in mystery, unknown even to the most powerful members of society.
-They want the kingdom to collapse because they feel that an absolute monarchy is a step backwards for civilization, instead of forwards, which would be an anarcho-capitalist dystopia (typical cyberpunk).

-The kingdom is going through a financial, political and social crisis. The king, once known as a fair, kind and wise leader, is losing political power and his influence over the people. This is mostly being caused by the Illuminati through political games, financing criminals, providing aid to enemy nations and jeopardizing social programs, but it's also the king's fault, as he's becoming senile and less capable of ruling the people, despite his good intentions.

-The king knows about the Illuminati's meddling, but can't stop them because of the laws he himself created to give privacy and freedom to his people. He can't expose the Illuminati either because he doesn't have any concrete proof of their existence, much less of their actions against him.
-In order to effectively stop the Illuminati from hampering his kingdom, he feels that he needs to install martial law so he could do whatever needs to be done to root them out and banish them. However, he needs a reason to justify such a drastic change in his government, and that's when he devised a plan to fake the prince's assassination.
-His plan would also legitimize him becoming immortal and ruling forever, since his only heir would've perished. He felt that he had to do so because he genuinely believes he's the only one who cares about his people, and is thus the only one who could lead them and stop the Illuminati from destroying his nation.
-The reason for the whole ordeal, instead of just straight up murdering the prince, is that the king isn't entirely evil, and preferred not to kill his own son.

-The Rebellion is a group of people that're tired of the deplorable state the kingdom is in and are against the king's rule, as they feel he's out of touch and becoming senile, if not insane. They're simply treated as a criminal rebel group, though, and are persecuted by the king's forces, including Zima, who confronts them in several of the bounties (side quests) she does.
-They are not exactly against the kingdom, though, and simply want the king to step down and pass the crown onto the prince, as the prince has actually talked with them in secret, listening to their complaints, agreeing that the king is slowly losing his mind and that something fishy is going on (the Illuminati's tampering, which is not fully known by him).

*The story after Chapter 2:

-Start of Chapter 3
-Zima decides to go to the commercial capital after discovering, through an intense investigation of the gang's base, that both the woman who planted the bomb in the prince's car, and the mysterious &quot;Woman With The Ring&quot;, are hiding there. (The first scene of chapter 3 is her arriving at the commercial capital.)
-Zima meets one of the other members of the Justice once she arrives. The Just comments on her recent actions, either telling her that she &quot;won't make any friends&quot; if she just keeps killing everyone that confronts her, or praising her compassion and dilligent work if she has been arresting most of them. This is foreshadowing for the end of the game.
-Zima finds out through various sources in the Commercial Capital (including the woman who planted the bomb in the prince's car) that the ones responsible for the prince's assassination were the Illuminatti (The Woman With The Ring's organization).
-The Illuminati actually have nothing to do with the whole ordeal, but they're well aware of the King's plot. However, they manipulated the information Zima was given in order to lure her into finding and joining them, and even if she doesn't, to discover the king's plans and bring him down for them.
-She discovers the location of the Illuminati's &quot;secret headquarters&quot;, and heads there to confront them.
-Zima infliltrates the hideout, and confronts a group of women (posing as the head of the Illuminatti, but that're actually just a proxy to them).
-They tell her about themselves and present their motivations and goals, asking her to join them, telling her that the prince is still alive.
-Zima refuses, and fights the group, emerging victorious and discovering the prince's location: A remote, supposedly abandoned military base.

-Start of Chapter 4
-She travels to a small town close to the base. After some intel gathering, she infiltrates the base, that's being guarded by an unknown army (working for the king). She finds the prince in a luxurious room and without any restraints, much to her confusion.
-After leaving the base with her, the prince reveals the whole secret plot of the king to Zima.
-The prince, tired of being just a political tool and a fake promise of renewal for the kingdom, decides to stand up to his father and take the throne.
-After dropping the prince in a safe location with his &quot;friends&quot; (unknown to Zima, the Rebellion), she calls the king and demands an explanation.
-Zima's questioning and legitimate arguments drive the king over the edge, and fearing she would side with the prince and overthrow him, he declares her a public enemy and orders the entire Justice corps to go after her and the prince.

-Start of Chapter 5
-Zima travels back to the kingdom in order to stop the king, fighting the other members of the Justice corps along the way. Each of them confronts her in their own unique way (direct confrontation, stealth assassination, sniping, etc), but if Zima has been arresting her enemies instead of killing them, they believe her version of the story and decide to join her in protecting the prince. If Zima has been killing everyone that stands in her path, however, they either die by her hand or don't believe her, thinking she has gone insane or has betrayed the kingdom.
-Zima eventually arrives and infiltrates the palace, finally meeting the king face to face.
-After the king more calmly explains his motives and the situation he's in, Zima feels very conflicted, but seeing as he won't stop with his plans, and that he has gone completely mad with his plans of becoming an immortal, tyrannical ruler, she battles him.
-After dealing with the king, either by killing or arresting him (this is justified because the king broke several of the laws he himself wrote), Zima receives a call from the prince telling her that his hideout is under attack by a massive, extremely powerful army in black.
-This is the Illuminati's military force, sent to assassinate the prince now that the king has been brought down, in order to destroy the monarchy for good.

-Start of Chapter 6
-Zima hastily makes for the secret location the prince is held in, and with a lot of difficulty tries to fight back the forces that were sent to dispatch of him.
-It is at this moment that the players' actions throughout the game (killing or arresting his enemies) come into play.
&gt;If she spared most of the people she confronted, thus earning the rest of the Justice corps' trust, they come in to help her fight back the army, and they emerge victorious. The prince takes the throne, exposing the whole ordeal to the people, freeing Zima of her charges. The Illuminati suffer a massive blow in their cover, credibility and military power, and go into hiding to recover, leaving the kingdom to prosper under the new king's rule.
&gt;However, if Zima killed the other Justs, or if they didn't believe her because of her murderous tendencies, they don't come to her aid. The prince is killed while Zima tries to fight back the army, and she is eventually overwhelmed and killed too. With the kingdom in shambles, the Illuminati's plans succeed, and human civilization advances to it's next step in evolution, an anarcho-capitalist dystopia, as seen in most cyberpunk works.

May 10 2020, Raster

Zima arrives at the Commercial Capital HQ following the lead on the Woman with the ring. Rather than briefed by a Marshal, she meets with the five Justs of the capital. They know that the Woman with the ring’s organization is somewhere in the Capital and it will take some sleuthing to figure it out. The Justs agree to help Zima with the case and split up to search for clues from the three Dons of the capital that control the: nightclub, casino and sporting arena. The player can tackle these three in any order. Going on patrols/bounties in this chapter will allow Zima to ask a Just to join her. These fights will be scaled up to compensate but perhaps can be a bit easier than the fights in Chapter 2 to reinforce the Justs as powerful allies. Whichever Don you meet first will make clear that all three are in contact with this secret organization (so the Illuminati can prepare to exert power over the Kingdom covertly).

Arena: Player can visit at any time to place bets on duels. It is mandatory for the player to participate in 3v3 duels with blah blah. The opponents cheat with help from sponsors/wealthy gambling backers, so Zima must spend her own money and talk to the right people to sneak in brass knuckles, medicinal spray, pocket gun, etc (and cooperate with the pair of Justs). This is also an opportunity to throw in any enemy designs that don’t fit the rest of the game, since the opponents need to be more menacing than regular goons. Becoming the champ of the arena grants a request from the Don, and Zima asks for a key to the Illuminati. 
at the end you have to fight each other and the fight stops before things get serious, and it's echoed in their real boss fight


Casino: Player can visit at any time to gamble, but must gamble against the Don and convince him to bet his Illuminati key, and defeat him in the duel. As collateral, Zima bets her Just partner 

Nightclub: Zima visits with Just Cool Dude, you need to talk your way through some interesting situations: drinking at the bar, Zima drying to dance, sneaking backstage to talk to the owner.  Zima meets with the Don who is aware that she is a Just and poisons her, but Zima is saved by the other Just who shows up in the nick of time. He tells everyone after that Zima partied too hard. Calls her “Zima dude”

With all keys in hand Zima and the Justs enter the Illuminati HQ in CYBERSPACE who tell them of their plan. However they can’t be destroyed in their own world so Zima and crazy onee-sama who is trapped with her in a dungeon must work together to hack terminals to make each Illuminati proxy vulnerable.
there could be dialogue where the other Just is in awe of Zima's hacking abilities and Zima thinks &quot;I just smashed the keyboard&quot;

            <Text>Lore

the kingdom is made of colonies, and the two planets they have are not habitable, but resource fonts
the human alliance (or whatever the name we give them), have a lot of habitable planets, that's why they have 12 stars on the flag
the small region is the country attacking the kingdom on the start of the game
the kingdom can had a war with them long time ago and took almost all their colonies that rested
and there's another region/alliance that can play like the neutral state
just to give more substance for the world building and not be just a two-sided thing



several generations ago there was a global war that ended in the creation of new countries and states. During this period a large amount of money controlled by nobles was lost. In the years to follow, King Yor's father, who I should really give a damn name to, established the monarchy and the modern kingdom. The lost wealth landed in the hands of the Illuminati, who have been using their wealth and power to work towards bringing all humanity under one (invisible) sect of leaders. They stay in the shadows because their end goal isn't power but rather to control ideology, thought and culture. They believe this is best employed silently rather than through direct thought (point to King as an example of open culture control that has failed, with examples of terrorism and general hate for him).

In a rapid amount of time the Illuminati has gained control of the other major nations. Through economic pressure, terrorism and a settlement of keeping kings and councils as political figureheads. These nations are largely responsible for the Kingdom's oil, entertainment and energy trades. Meanwhile the Kingdom has built a sizable military power. As the King learns of the Illuminati and his paranoia grows, the Kingdom increases its military spending and decreases outside trade. The King and the Illuminati are in a stalemate for this and other reasons like King lacking proof of Illuminati's presence.

--

Anyway we're all on a giant space ship in outer space. Not the modern kind but like a giant space cruise liner/pirate ship. For whatever reason we're lightyears away from home planets. The Kingdom rests by a gas giant and asteroid belt for fuel and minerals. Because the ship doesn't rotate, the upper class and farmland faces the sun and it's always daytime, while the lower class is always in night and many of the people work in upkeep/military/resource mining. The layers of the ship as well as each wing are strongly secured by the government to keep people in their proper place.

The mining town Zima visits in Ch4 is a settlement on one of the asteroids. The ships explain why there is such little commerce between the Kingdom and other places, as well as why the Illuminati can't launch a full-scale invasion.  It also puts the Kingdom in a cultural bubble.

--

like the patriots, the illuminati has power because of a large sum of money similar to philosopher's legacy, left over from revolution that put first King in place (turbulence that disrupted all countries)

because King's revolution meant his share of wealth wasn't pooled with the rest, meant that King hsan't been influenced by Illuminati which sprung from free market deregulation.

King's empire has less of a class divide, drug problem, etc. Monarchy means people enjoy less freedoms but are protected from excess. Kingdom is a strong military provider and therefore is able to freely trade with the other nations without worry of takeover.

Other nations used the money to build their own military but also to create necessities like oil, entertainment, nuclear energy. Things that would be shut off from the kingdom if there was a war. The leaders of these other nations and the secret council that controls them know that the King can't fight them, but they also know they can't fight the King due to his stronger military force. Starting a war would lead to death and a bad economy (there is no point to starting a war economy if you control everything unless you want a totalitarian state like the King). And so there is a cold war between them. Illuminati would prefer a puppet leader: had offered this to the King who declined, and had considered assassination and offering the throne to the Prince but again, increased paranoia and military power. 

Although in this situation the Illuminati have a large amount of money and power, it isn't their end goal. Rather, they seek to control ideology, thought and culture to advance humans to a higher level of thinking. They believe this is best employed silently rather than through direct thought (point to King as an example of open culture control that has failed, with examples of terrorism and general hate for him).</Text>

use spanish or portugese names for a nation?

this coalition of nations sees the kingdom as villains (think relationship of other nations, to Russia, NK, etc

what does the kingdom stand for? invert that and you've got the coalition's values

much like the EU, there is talk of unifying the military (which would vastly overpower the kingdom's)

            <Title>Dialog</Title>
            <Text>DIALOG TIPS

Generally dialogue has you needing to find information from someone, or they're &quot;quirky&quot; and you profile them.

e.g. What's with the gold teeth? Why did you become a clown?

Or you need to find out information from someone:
Did he have any enemies?
Where can I find such and such?

When characters answer, they go on tangents. Conversations are also broken up into multiple proceeding questions before they go on too long.

When in doubt, give the player interaction by letting them choose between a serious or silly answer.

Because of the tangents, it's easy to break up dialog into short bits that go on quick tangents to explain important information such as lore.

Players need to find someone, blend in with the area

Ideas for the building:
- Need to get off at different floors in the elevator
- Offices at the top, conference rooms, then lobby
- Hotel maybe? Does that mean there are regular people in here too?
- Is it like Die Hard where some floors are under construction?
- What if Zima has to press buttons to stop floors and doesn't know what's on the other side? First time it's concerned citizens, next couple of times it's goons, then maybe dead goons because there's another Just in the area.
- Beforehand the player stops to get further briefed about the civvs in the building. Zima needs to call the elevator which has an extra step to it? Exploring a little in a later area will offer a potion to reward the player a little (include this in the rest of the game!)
- Extra steps to the elevator could mean:
	- Finding the key for the door
	- Hacking it
	- Going down a floor from the fire 	escape and entering the elevator from 	there</Text>

Zima: “I’ve called you all for a task of great importance. You all know I’m tracking the murder of Prince Ygne.”
Leto: “Death. Death of Prince Ygne. Unless you have news to share with us on that, Zima?”
Zima: “Security footage at the scene and a tip from a crime ring in Outer Rim. There’s a woman we’re looking for, and she’s bound to be here.”
Leto: “That’s all you have to go on?”
Zima: “Will you help or not?”
Vesna: “We would have to pay visits to each of the Dons.”
Veter: “There’s three Dons in Commercial. Each one has a huge amount of money and influence over this town.”
Osen: “They pretty much own the place.”
Veter: “If this goes all the way to the top like you think it does, the Dons will know about it. But it wouldn’t be easy. We would be walking into hotspots of crime.”
Padat: “How do we know that your hunch will be worth this risk?”
Zima: “You’re not wrong. I’ll do this on my own if I have to.”

*If the player has been killing a lot*
Leto: “Let’s talk about your fighting, Zima. We’ve heard you’ve been doing a lot of it.”

Osen: “Yeah, like a lot! And killing too!”

Leto: “Maybe taking things too far for a servant of the people.”
Padat: “You will not make many friends with this kind of approach.”
Vesna: “I don’t think it’s so bad. Zima’s just doing her job right? Scaring all the baddies straight?”
Veter: “And yet, that kind of crazy says you know how to handle yourself. But… play it a bit cooler from now on, ok?”
Zima: “…Mh, I’ll keep it in mind. 
Zima: “With that out of the way, let’s finish this case, shall we?”
}
*If the player has been arresting a lot*
Leto: “Normally, I wouldn’t. This could put all our lives in danger. But you’ve earned a reputation among Justs.”
Osen: “You’ve been doing a good job!”
Padat: “It’s not always easy to spare someone in the heat of battle, yet you do.”
Vesna: “I think you could be a little tougher on people. Just my preference.”
Zima: “Thanks everyone. Then, let’s finish this.”
}

Osen: “Ooh, we can show you around and help you meet the Dons! Doesn’t that sound like fun?”
Padat: “The Commercial Capital is large and loosely governed. We are the best help you will get.”
Leto: “It is part of the job, after all.”
Veter: “I’m down for a fun time.”
Vesna: “I’ll take any chance to make some noise in Commercial.”
Zima: “Right then, let’s pay a visit to these Dons.”
Vesna: “We’ll split up for recon and wait on you to start moving.”
[[From this point, once the player leaves the HQ, the Justs’ will be gone, cutting off dialogue options.]]

Veter: “I heard you dealt with that freak--good job. Before he was grappling you, he was breaking skulls down by the port.”
Leto: “Another military grunt that got tired of following orders.”
Padat: “If I may ask, Herr Zima, how did you defeat him?”

*If player used their fists*
Zima: “I beat the tar out of him.”
*If player used their guns*
Zima: “I shot the hell out of him.”
*If player used intimidate twice or more*
Zima: “I intimidated the hell out of him.”
}
Padat: “Very nice.”

Vesna: “Don’t stir up too much trouble without us, Just.”
If you haven’t asked for help yet, the shop, patrol and bounties are available, but the three story locations are unavailable. The Justs won’t be out on patrol, so expect patrol and bounties to kick your ass and make the player appreciate their help more.

On returning to HQ, random chance of one of the Justs greeting you (if Justs are present):
Osen: “Welcome back, Sister Zima!”

Ask about Prince:
Zima: “Do you think the Prince is still alive?”
Osen: “I sure hope so! He’s ever so charming!”

            <Text>CJ Act 3 - Casino
Raster - Jan 31, 2021

Casino: Player can visit at any time to gamble, but must gamble against the Don and convince him to bet his Illuminati key, and defeat him in the duel. As collateral, Zima bets her Just partner.

This chapter is with Leto (Not-Char), a cool yet pleasant Just who doesn’t show her feelings (much like Zima).

Minigame is 1-suit, 1v1 blackjack best of 3, with cheats
Characters will talk throughout the blackjack game (both dialog and battle barks)

Leto’s power is psychic stuff (reads Zima’s mind at one point). 
Helps you cheat at cards, while the enemy is cheating at cards
Suggestions:
-showing you the top card of the deck
-forcing you to take an action and you need to prepare for it
-e.g. “you will be forced to go prone in two turns”
-battle buffs/debuffs
-disabling a combat action
-”Zima, the enemy can’t block!”



-Zima goes to the casino
-Small puzzle/conversation to get inside?
-Leto introduces herself with a card trick
-Gets inside, meets with Leto
-They talk, sit down at one of the tables and go through a series of “battles” (blackjack)
-Battles are fought against the dealer, every few battles the house brings in a different dealer and the rules change in some way
-Zima can always optionally play hands for cash at any time
-Can talk to Leto throughout the battles, lots of chances for character growth
-The house cheats, but so does Zima with the help of Leto
-Final battle, Zima bets Leto’s life, and all the chips earned thus far, for the Samaritan Key
-Can talk to other patrons

Main hall:
-Talk with leto
-Play table
-Talk to cashier (cash out, exchange chips for prizes)
-Exit
-Check area
-check a bunch of other stuff

—talk to patrons
-talk to bartender (buy a drink, gossip)

Casino will need to be broken up into two rooms:
Gambling zone and cash/bar/band zone

Gambling Zone:
-Talk with Leto
-Play table
-Check room
-Go to Entrance

Cash zone:
-check room
-talk with leto
-talk to patrons
-talk to cashier
-go to tables
-exit

Leto is in both “rooms”, can be talked to as an object in one but can appear in conversations in the other

Zima plays a round she can't win
Chooses to beat up the owner instead
&quot;anybody else owe this guy?&quot;
people in the casino beat on him as Zima and Leto escape

Zima can't win on the final round because the house asks her concentrating friend to stand aside. So after you lose you beat him up 



Blin! (Fudge!)

What will Leto’s personality be like?
Not-Char

Just Leto:
“Cards are a gentleman’s game—if you can read a gambler’s play, you read into their soul.”
“I care to waste little energy on fighting. But I won’t stand for injustice!”
Zima (thinks something), Leto responds because she read Zima’s mind
“It is the challenge, not the victory, that is important.”
Russian aristocrat, when she gets nervous, excited, angry, etc she uses Russian slang. “Blin! I lost!”
Quite loyal and holds all Just and authority figures in respect. Also holds deep grudges. Enjoys engaging in games of wit and psychological warfare. A prideful Just (unlike Zima who is humble)

But the question I need to ask with every Just is: what are they as a cop? What do they say about being a cop?
Zima: doing the right thing is difficult, a cop’s duty lies with her government and not toward civilians, cops have to be willing to risk their lives. Being a cop is a lifestyle and requires diligent training for optimal job performance.
Vesna: cops are as flawed as normal people are. They can be snobbish, prone to emotional impulse, yet they hold the guns and are responsible for our lives.
Padat: some cops come from lives of injustice, and do what they do to change society for the better
Osen: some cops just want to shoot things.
Leto, who is psychic, nonviolent, aristocratic: A cop’s duty is to maintain law and order above all else, and this must be done with minimal damage to anyone and ideally, minimum intervention from the police.
Veder: being a cop is just a job—you get the job done and punch out the clock. Thinks Zima takes it too seriously

This puts King and Prince above Justs, they are royalty. King will do anything to preserve his power as he believes that will be the best for his citizens. The Just are muscle to make that happen. For the Prince the Just are loyal followers that he holds in equal regard, but for less selfish reasons

Just gambling powers are needed for all blackjack games, so we’ll have the player instigate casual and story blackjack games by talking to the dealer, which will call over Leto. After getting the key, Leto will tell Zima to call her when she wants to play a table, which will happen automatically when Zima reenters the casino.</Text>

PLAY TABLE
TALK TO LETO [not available at first]
  TALK TO PATRONS
  RETURN TO ENTRANCE

Check room:
Zima: (Patrons murmur back and forth under the jingle of slot machines. There’s a strong smell of perfume and tobacco in the lounge.)

Play table:
Zima: (Should I play for fun or for the key?) Fun/Key/Leave
If fun or key:
Zima: “Hey, good luck charm.”
Leto: “I’m here.”
[[need a bunch of phrases for calling Leto over]]

Talk to patrons:
First time:
Patron: “

Zima would ask stuff like “Does the house cheat?”
“Do you gamble here often?”
“What can you tell me about the owner of the casino?”
“Any blackjack tips?”

“Pick a card, Madam.”
  “Leto, we don’t have time for this.”
“Nonsense. And put the card back in the deck, please.“
“Are you even armed? I’ll need your help to send this place packing.”
  “That won’t be necessary. Zima, you’ve stepped into my world. I have a way of doing things that is more… subtle.”
(She smiles and pulls a card. The eight of diamonds, as I had chosen.)
“You wish for something from this casino’s owner. I say why risk our lives, and more importantly, those of these innocent patrons, when you can beat this casino at its own game.”
  “And leverage my skills as a Just.”
“And what would those skills be, beyond parlor card tricks?”
  (Leto’s voice echoes through my mind. Her eyes are closed and her lips stay pursed with a hint of a smile.)
  (”Tricks like this. Powers of suggestion. Could change your luck.”)
“It takes all my focus so I can’t play at the same time. I need you on this.”
“My my. But if things get hairy, all bets are off.”

“The goal of Blackjack is to get as close to a card value total of 21 without going any higher. Face cards are worth ten, and aces can be worth either one or eleven. If you reach 21, you instantly win.”
“Otherwise, you may continue drawing cards until you choose to keep your value and see if your score beats the dealer’s, or you go over 21 and lose the hand.”
“’Hit’ will draw another card and ‘Stay’ keeps your hand to compare against the dealer’s.”

—
Playing a table for the Key
-
First time:
Zima: “If we’re playing by your rules, we need a way to bring Primorie out to see us. Winning tons of royals at one table will get his attention.”
Leto: “Then you’d better go all-in on each hand. And make no mistakes.”
